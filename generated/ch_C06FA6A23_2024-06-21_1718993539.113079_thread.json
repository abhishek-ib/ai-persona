      "message": ":wave: :bar_chart: CICD Updates!\nHi there!\nSo it's been a fun few weeks on the RelEng side, and we've been dealing with several unplanned incidents and efforts on various fronts - but we've still be getting a couple fun things done!\n\nFirst up: Telemetry updates! The OpenTelemetry Plugin in Jenkins was updated recently to make life much easier when trying to add custom attributes to telemetry data coming out of our pipelines - particularly being able to do things like:\n```pipeline {\n    options {\n        withSpanAttributes([\n          spanAttribute(key: 'ib.stack.tenant.id', value: TENANT_ID, target: 'PIPELINE_ROOT_SPAN'),\n          spanAttribute(key: 'ib.stack.legacy_build', value: LEGACY_SVC_BUILD, target: 'PIPELINE_ROOT_SPAN'),\n        ])\n    }\n}```\nThis allows us to build things like this Stack Deployment State (https://grafana.cicd.instabase.com/goto/GadPygwIR?orgId=1) dashboard, allowing us to see at a glance if one or more stacks has been consistently building and deploying properly, failing, rendered unstable, etc. It will hopefully help reduce questions of \"this stack failed to deploy - did something change recently?\" by making it easy to see if the stack was already unstable / failing prior. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nYou can also click on any given \"state box\" in the panel and it will give you a direct link to that stack's Deployment Manager GUI! We'll add more drill-down links as we get more and better data collected. :+1:\n\n*Note:* There's a gap in the data, a result of the confluence of \"Cody had to fix data collection and dropped some broken bits\" and \"all the builds are failing because of an unrelated service dependency breakage upstream\" :smile: It should be more consistent going forward.",
