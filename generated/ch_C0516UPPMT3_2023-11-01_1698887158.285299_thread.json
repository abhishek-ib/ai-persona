It caught me out, but the (Japanese) client at least let out the loudest belly laugh of the conference :) He also appreciated the candor of a live demo. But still curious why this particular request required advanced mode. It doesn’t seem to need it for other languages (ps the response with normal model reads “as an ai model I don’t understand Japanese” which it gave in perfect Japanese so it is a little weird.",
