      "message": ":alarm: :alarm: :alarm:\n\nHi folks! As some of you may have noticed, dogfood has been slow for the past week or two. It turns out that this was caused by this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/49941), which enabled Oracle server stats polling.\n\nHowever, I can't fix the problem immediately, since folks have services running on their laptops that are connected to dogfood, and these services are putting a ton of load on the DB.\n\n:star: *So, I need everyone who is running services locally on their laptop to do the following ASAP:* :star: \n\n1. Modify `env-local.json` to set `\"db_enable_server_stats\": false`  under `\"base\"`\n2. Run `ppy restart core` to restart all services that connect to the DB. You can also just stop them: `ppy stop core`\nThank you, I appreciate it!",
