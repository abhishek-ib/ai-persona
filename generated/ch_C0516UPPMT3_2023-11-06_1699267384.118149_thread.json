Alternatively, has something like this been created for Enterprise which we can adapt? (cc: @Matt Weaver @Lee @Tom @hannah @Chris @aristo @peter) I imagine at larger customers that this will come up often from their vendor teams.\n\nAttaching the survey (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13lZU1o--NaXPdQewc0vFGRzmHLI5lEeV/edit#gid=858826395) they sent over which initially asked around some of these themes which was filled in by our team.",
