It should point to http://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/converse/#how-to-ask-converse-great-questions . I feel like these keep coming up as one-offs, but all links that go out to docs should be changed to aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/ (http://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/)… rather than aihub.instabase.com/hub/docs/ (http://aihub.instabase.com/hub/docs/)….",
