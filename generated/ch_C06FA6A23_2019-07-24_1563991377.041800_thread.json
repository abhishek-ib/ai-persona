      "message": "Hi all — when writing Python code in Flow (and ideally all Python code) , when you return “Tuple[ResultType, Text]” please move to “Tuple[ResultType, IBError]“.\n\nIn the immediate term, using a rich IBError object allows us to retain a user-level message, and the stack trace for when the error occurred. In the future, we could stuff things like “which user is this error associated with, and many other pieces of metadata”\n\nThe code to use it is here:\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/shared-utils/py-utils/errors/src/py/instabase/errors/ib_error.py#L148\n\nFYI @Jonathan Shih is changing some of the Emerson Python code to use IBError. This came up because a customer had issues, and we can’t get the logs easily. However, if the Flow code propagates an IBError, then the stack trace will magically show up in the .ibflowresults and will make debugging much easier!\n\nFor those interested in a longer history, here’s the design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s54mCHcsfQN0efhczeCLOuqahnvry5Hg98l67dB_CVw/edit#heading=h.ut0u9amo1h31. Feel free to ask @Jesika Haria questions about it",
