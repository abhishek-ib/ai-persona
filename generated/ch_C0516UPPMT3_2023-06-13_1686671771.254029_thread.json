One of the largest warranty, equipment insurance, and equipment inspection companies in the world. This is their Canada branch. You're right regarding batch. I think this is a subtle feedback we have seen before, that it is not always obvious to the first user how and/or if you can build this into a workflow. As most people start in converse, a subsequent prompt in the converse experience to lift those fields into a workflow automation could be very cool",
