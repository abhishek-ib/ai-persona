For Q3 we shipped the 21.10.0 release so officially this is the release customers would have to take for any features promised in Q3. \nThat being said, i’m not too familiar with specific work we did to GA scheduler. iirc some work was done in the July/August time frame. Would need Kerry to chime in on this.",
