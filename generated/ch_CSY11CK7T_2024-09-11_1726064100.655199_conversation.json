      "message": ":tada: *Milestone in AI Hub  frontend code restructuring efforts!* :tada:\n\nI am excited to share the incredible progress we’ve made in restructuring and standardizing the AI Hub frontend code for *better maintenance, scalability, and developer productivity*.\n\nSince the inception of this initiative, all frontend developers have effectively embraced the new structure, progressively transitioning existing code while actively contributing in the updated format. Here’s a summary of our progress to date:\n\n:chart_with_upwards_trend: From *Release 24.12 to 24.36*, we’ve made huge strides:\n• Files under the *NEW* code structure have grown by *160%* (from 406 to 1057) :rocket:\n• Code lines in the *NEW* code structure have increased by *125%* (from 44k to nearly 100k) :bar_chart:\n• In total, the *NEW* structure now represents *51%* of our files and *43%* of our codebase, compared to *33%* and *32%* at the start!\nThis initiative, while ongoing, reflects our shared dedication to enhancing our codebase while managing the demands of continuous development. Each release brings us closer to the complete adoption of the restructured format, positioning us for sustained success.\n\nI will continue to update further milestones here. For more details regarding this effort, you can refer to the proposal document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_luXmNqjVe2KIso08XxYZUS8ZKSpb9XmpINzOo3LbNY/edit?usp=sharing), and the overall progress is tracked here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JjQ1mJHl8FpjmoCLTaEw0wzgIwtSB3krKmWzbitLXa0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n:clap: *Kudos to everyone* involved for your contributions so far! Let's keep the momentum going and continue pushing forward. :clap:",
