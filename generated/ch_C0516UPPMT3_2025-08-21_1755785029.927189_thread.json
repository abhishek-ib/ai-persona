      "message": "Hi team, I had a call with a commercial customer (Expatrio) and they had feedback around accuracy testing/metrics. What they want to achieve is for each application version they're about to roll out, they want a document level STP rate (e.g. X% of the 50 documents they tested will be automated with this version of the app). I don't think they can do this currently. With our emphasis on STP rate with DocAI, I do think that accuracy tests and deployment metrics should be updated to reflect this focus (document level metrics as well as field level metrics)",
