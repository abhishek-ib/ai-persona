If you want to build a docker image with python3 support, run `make USE_PY3=true build-docker` in the directory of any service that supports it. If you find one that was missed, hit me up and I’ll be happy to update it as well. To track the steps required to be fully on python 3, you can view https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKdDZPELc8noNMk1O578ZPrPIKzDj1OPPTqDHTybtDQ/edit#gid=0 And feel free to grab anything from that sheet and fix it if you’re feeling froggy :smile:",
