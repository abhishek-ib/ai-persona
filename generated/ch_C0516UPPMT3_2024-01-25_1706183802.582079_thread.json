      "message": "I have a few bits of feedback about the new table detection and highlighting feature in AI Hub build. In my testing so far the detection seems pretty good!\n1. It would be useful to know if anything has been detected before clicking on the icon, can we change the colour of the lightbulb icon to purple if something has been found? \n2. You’re able to turn on the highlighting even if nothing has been found, wouldn’t it make more sense to disable the checkbox if nothing detected?\n3. You’re able to view, copy and download the table. I don’t see why copy and download is a useful feature when in edit mode in build.\n4. I was expecting to see a ‘make field from this table’ option. \n5. Are there plans for listing other entities under this view? For example i’d like to see signatures and checkboxes under here too. \nAt the moment lots of customers think the edit mode in build _is_ the app. I’ve seen people upload 200 documents to edit mode as they think this is the only way of ‘running’ the solution. Having features like copy and download of the table reinforces that this is where you run your documents through to extract data, rather than this view being strictly for configuration.\n\ncc: @hannah @Bastiane",
