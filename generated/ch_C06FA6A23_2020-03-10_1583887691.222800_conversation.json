Not sure how much we want to use GPU’s or learn more about deep learning:\n\n“Kevin and I curate an ecosystem of startups in the FinTech verticals, would be great to learn your use cases and how you leverage GPU today, and see how we can collaborate (tech, go-to-market, etc.)\n\nThe training session is offered based on Deep Learning Institute at NVIDIA, more details regarding AI training sessions will be provided from Inception program. \n\nLet me know if you are interested in getting a call to discuss what you are working on and how we can collaborate.“”\"\n\n*Given the current conditions I think it may be a month or two before we can have them come into a workshop focused on Deep Learning/GPU based use cases but trying to figure out how to leverage our newest partnership!*",
