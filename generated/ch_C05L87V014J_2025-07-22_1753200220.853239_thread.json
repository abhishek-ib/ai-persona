      "message": "Hi Team,\nOur development time is being significantly hampered by persistent crafting issues, with an alarming 50% of our team's time currently dedicated to debugging and finding workarounds. This demands our immediate and dedicated attention.\nHere's a breakdown of the critical issues:\n1. *Crafting Sandbox Bootup Failure (ecr-login):* While a workaround exists, it's a short-term solution requiring manual intervention every 6 hours or after each sandbox restart.\n2. *Data Sources Not Indexing in Crafting:* Data sources mounted to crafting are failing to index. Entries are added to ``ingestion_items``, but the calls are not reaching ``job-service`` or ``celery-app-tasks``. This is a major blocker for the chatbot team's development.\n3. *Non-Persistent Indexes in Crafting:* Every sandbox restart results in the loss of all indexes in ``wevaiate-titan``. This is extremely frustrating as it invalidates all chatbots and leads to the complete loss of any previously indexed data sources.\nThe inability to test data sources in crafting is completely blocked due to these issues.\nLMK, If I can be of help in any way, let's try to close on these.\ncc: @Balaram @mfichman @Gaurav Saini",
