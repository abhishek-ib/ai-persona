      "message": "Hi Team,\nI have concerns about the naming of the \"Converse\" app.\n\nReferences to \"Converse\", \"Chat\", \"Have conversations with any document with Converse, built on GPT models\" all imply that you can actually hold a conversation (in ChatGPT style).\n\nThe converse app currently has no memory of previous prompts and answers each time you enter a new prompt, so raising user's expectations that they can chat back-and-forth with a document then makes the whole app feel broken.\n\nCan we either...\nA) Rename the app to something else like \"Explore\" so that user's aren't expecting a conversational experience which will then make the app feel broken\nB) Implement memory of previous prompts and responses so that the user can actually 'converse' back-and-forth with the document.",
