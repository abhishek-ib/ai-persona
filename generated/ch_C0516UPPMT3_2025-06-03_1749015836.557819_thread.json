      "message": "Hey team, could do with some help understanding what's going on here (I am really pushing my understanding of file types, downloads and Instabase back end...). As per this (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1749011949485549) thread - I wanted to understand how sub-document file sizes stack up against the original uploaded file.\n\nIn this (https://nab.internal.instabase.com/review/c5957170-f80d-491a-9736-cfeae6622c36) run I uploaded a 20MB document. Post-processing we generate:\n• A PDF image link here (https://nab.internal.instabase.com/nab/hamish.campbell.nabpov_instabase.com/fs/Instabase%20Drive/app-runs/57fc4f4e-ba2f-4f76-90b6-1244a29efaf9/49697560-2601-4863-998e-355b1348ef19/s1_process_files/images/test.pdf_p0.JPEG.JPEG). This seems to be a replica of the originally uploaded file and when downloaded from the file system it is 34MB\n    ◦ I don't understand why this is bigger than the original 20MB\n    ◦ What's causing this increase and how would it scale? Is it related to the number of pages or some other deterministic operation?\n• Links to each individual sub-document e.g. here https://nab.internal.instabase.com/nab/hamish.campbell.nabpov_instabase.com/fs/Instabase%2[…]pply_classifier/generated/test.pdf.pdf.Passport-1-1.pdf (https://nab.internal.instabase.com/nab/hamish.campbell.nabpov_instabase.com/fs/Instabase%20Drive/app-runs/57fc4f4e-ba2f-4f76-90b6-1244a29efaf9/49697560-2601-4863-998e-355b1348ef19/s3_apply_classifier/generated/test.pdf.pdf.Passport-1-1.pdf)\n    ◦ Sub-documents all add up to the 34 MB which makes sense\n    ◦ Biggest increase seems to come from page sizes. E.g. highest page documents are the biggest files by some distance",
