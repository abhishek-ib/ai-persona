You can use a dummy name to test it if you want\n• Delete the `snapshot-update` sandbox\nThe `cypress` snapshot is basically the same as the `instabase-dev` snapshot. The difference is how we spin up `webpack`, where the `bin/webpack` script checks for a `IS_CYPRESS` flag (but this shouldn’t be relevant to what you’re doing)",
