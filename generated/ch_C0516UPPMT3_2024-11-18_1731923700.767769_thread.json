      "message": "i am creating a full-platform demo for Kering\nWhile creating a workspace, creating a build project, deploy it & want to add a Human-Review group, i find it a little irritating that there is a link saying: create a group here (with a link) and the link leads to the Kering Workspace, but without a “create Group” button.\nIf i dont have created a group already, I need to klick on members, click on group, create a group and add people.\nIf i have a group, i still dont know that i need to click on “add members”\n\nmy suggestion: either a direct create group button in the workspace settings OR the link from the deployment leads direct to create groups.\n\nHope its clear.",
