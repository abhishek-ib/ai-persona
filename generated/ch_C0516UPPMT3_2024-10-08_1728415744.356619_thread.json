It should be true that:\n1. Only that user can see the conversation and uploaded files\n2. The user will not be the system user that created the conversation, but they will be in the same org\n3. The conversation should persist for some period of time and then auto-delete (2 week retention)\nFrom the API does, it seems like I can use \"workspace\" to create a conversation for another user, but I can't figure out the right value of user ID and I keep getting a 404, failed to create a conversation.  Where do we get a user id for an org user?",
