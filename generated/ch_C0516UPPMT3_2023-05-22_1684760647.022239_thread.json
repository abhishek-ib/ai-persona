It could've been confusing for humans as well to decode the category. A great work there :tada: .The same code also depicts the parental guidance (which was confusing for me as well). Cross checking on the internet shows that the output was correct and the parental guidance is also UA.\n2. What is the expected output when the prompt is a single dot (`.`)?",
