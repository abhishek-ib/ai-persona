      "message": "hello team, for Kering, a french prospect, i got some questions which i answered with Legal.\nCan anyone quickly confirm that my answers are technicaly correct? Just want to make sure that all is correct before responding.\n\nThanks\n\n• Where do you keep *user logs* ? In some EU datacenter ? Will you ever move them to any other location ? Who has access to these logs ? Will you ever load these logs to other applications ? What is the retention period ?\n    ◦ *Production Logs*: Production logs (or system logs) are accessed only by Instabase employees. Logs are available for troubleshooting, auditing or capacity planning activities and access control is implemented to prevent unauthorized access, deletion or tampering. Instabase retains all logs for 90 days.\n    ◦ *Flow Logs* (known as run logs in AI Hub): Instabase provides Customers with logs for every run through the platform. Any user on the Customer’s account that has access to the run has access to the logs. Users can delete runs and their logs through API or can configure retention schedules to delete all runs and corresponding logs on defined internals.\n    ◦ *Storage Location*: Logs are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers located in the European Union and United States.\n    ◦ *Potential Movement*: Instabase is a global company, and log data may be accessed by employees outside of the EU to countries without an adequacy decision by the European Commission. Appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), are in place to ensure data security regardless of the processing location. However, efforts are taken to minimize personally identifiable data in logs.\n    ◦ *Loading to Other Applications*: Log data may be stored by vendors that Instabase has entrusted for purposes like indexing, monitoring, and trending.\n    ◦ *Retention Period*: The retention period for customer data, including logs, depends on the purpose for which it is used. Instabase retains customer data for as long as an account is active or in accordance with the customer’s instructions and agreements. Data is disposed of within 30 days of a customer requesting deletion or terminating their agreement, unless required by law to retain it longer.\n    ◦ Default log retention is configured for 90 days for our AI Hub and Saas products. \n• Where do you keep the *lease contracts* ? In some EU datacenter ? Will you ever move them to any other location ? Who has access ? Will you ever transfer data from the vector database to other applications ? What is the retention period ?\n    ◦ All Kering documents (lease contracts) are stored in Kering’s storage. Instabase does not store any documents. This means that Kering is responsible for document retention.\n    ◦ A customer may mount external storage buckets to store customer data. In this case, file governance will remain under the customer’s data governance and access policies for the customer’s complete control. If you have access to a mounted cloud storage drive (your own AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage Account) you always have access to delete the document content.\n    ◦ If using Instabase storage, in order to delete all the documents related to a conversation, the conversation should be deleted. This can be done in the interface or programmatically with APIs. Automatic conversation deletion is not in place, so customers must decide when they need to delete their conversations. \n    ◦ A batch of documents can be deleted programmatically with APIs.\n    ◦ By default, Instabase does not have access to customer data. Only authorized Instabase operators are permitted to access customer data and only for justifiable business cases- such as debugging failures or operational issues. In the case the Citi requires support or assistance with solution building, the customer can either: (a) request a screen-sharing session; or (b) with our SaaS offering- through its secure user management service.\n• Where do you keep the lease contracts sections corresponding to the *embeddings* ? In other words, where do you keep your *vector database* ? In some EU datacenter ? Will you ever move them to any other location ? Who has access ? Will you ever transfer data from the vector database to other applications ? What is the retention period ?\n    ◦ The vector database is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and will be located in the European Union.\n• By default, Instabase does not have access to customer data. Only authorized Instabase operators are permitted to access customer data and only for justifiable business cases- such as debugging failures or operational issues. In the case the Citi requires support or assistance with solution building, the customer can either: (a) request a screen-sharing session; or (b) with our SaaS offering- through its secure user management service.Where is located the *LLM* to which you feed the lease contract sections as part of prompts ? In some EU datacenter ? Will you ever move them to any other location ? Who has access ? Will you ever transfer data from the vector database to other applications ? What is the retention period ?\n    ◦ The LLM is processed in the EU.\n    ◦ Instabase has negotiated agreements with Open AI to ensure zero data-retention for any purpose, including preventing them from re-training their models on any of the data submitted to them through the Instabase platform. Past queries are stored in AI Hub databases and file system drives in order to provide customers with past conversations. Customers can choose where the data is stored and they can delete their data as/when needed\n    ◦ By default, Instabase does not have access to customer data. Only authorized Instabase operators are permitted to access customer data and only for justifiable business cases- such as debugging failures or operational issues. In the case the Customer requires support or assistance with solution building, the customer can either: (a) request a screen-sharing session; or (b) with our SaaS offering- through its secure user management service.\n\ncc: @Sanch",
