From various logs/grpc failures, the `GetMountPoints` grpc endpoint is likely the cause of this. I have a fix PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/71633) for it.\nThis endpoint is not performant, and it gets called whenever users visit the home page :sweat:\n\nThe good thing is that Cypress-cyp has so many orgs & drives, so the performance issue surfaces :blob-bear-dance:",
