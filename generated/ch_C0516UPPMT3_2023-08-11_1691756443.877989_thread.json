      "message": "Hey there, I was wondering why we are pinging so much SSPs (https://clearcode.cc/blog/what-is-supply-side-platform/) when loading AI hub (I come from the AdTech world, so theses are companies I know well) I can see Rubicon, Xandr (app nexus), Pubmatic, Facebook, Google etc. Thoses are usefull to sell targeted profile to DSPs. Targeted profile are built using browsing data and usage of the platform. Since we don't have ads and an audience that value privacy, I wanted to check if we are aware that aihub does that.",
