Per the sample response that you sent me, we discussed the possibility of having someone from the product team attend a meeting with Essor to directly hear their concerns/needs with project versioning.  Who would be best to attend that meeting?\n\nWe have a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 10th (a week from now) at 9a PT/noon ET where we will be discussing this.  Might that person be able to join in on this meeting for this purpose?",
