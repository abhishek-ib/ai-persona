Seeing as when the customer uses Research mode, it expends more tokens than general querying, do we have an enablement doc that outlines the types of questions a customer might need to turn Research mode on for vs when they can leave it off?\n\nMy thinking is the customer can use it as a guideline for phrasing and level of reasoning required so they can get the most amount of value as possible.\n\ncc @david.lee @Sanch",
