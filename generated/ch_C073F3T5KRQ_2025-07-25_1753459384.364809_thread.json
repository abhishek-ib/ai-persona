      "message": "1. yep you're right, they're only update on app creation. u can think about them as temp files where we write the necessary information and make sure everything if valid, and then copy them over to the deployed solution folder when it's time to package the ibflowbin and everything. same goes for the flow and modules that you'll see in the project folder\n2. hopefully 1 answers this, but yeah they're not mean to serve a purpose for the build project itself, but as a temporary location to write these files so they can be copied over to the deployed solution folder. maybe for internal use, it can be used as a way to track, but not the primary goal\n3. yeah so not sure what `post_extraction_schema` is for, we can look into that, but yeah in theory these things can be condensed into maybe one file or just schema.json and project_snapshot.json in the case that the schema is needed/read much more often than the entire project configuration \nso yeah i'd say the FS is not the source of truth for a project. the FS is used for storing extraction results and for these temp files to be copied over to the app folder which is the source of truth for that app. maybe this requires more documentation, but the distinction u can make there is that anything under `project/flows` is for the app/flow creation and not needed for the project itself\n\nw/ regards to the data model, yeah that was confusing to me too especially w/ the docs table. there's a figma in the doc matt sent that should be updated by the automate, analyze and core-services team to match the latest changes to help in the short term at least",
