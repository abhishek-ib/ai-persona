It aligns with the other filter-by-author categories (Created by Me, Apps from my organization)\n2. The Marketplace apps are all just Instabase-published apps as far as I can tell, so we might as well just say that rather than referring to a Marketplace that doesn’t really exist at the moment. (Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think we’ve seen much traction around organizations or individual developers wanting to publish their apps to other organizations.)\nIt also sets us up for any future changes to the Hub filtering UI, where we can just filter apps by _type_ (automation, advanced automation, chatbot) or by _author/publisher_ (me, my organization, Instabase).",
