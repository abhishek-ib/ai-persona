      "message": "I’ve noticed some confusion around “Fix version” vs “Fix Version-ST” from multiple people, hopefully this helps!\n\n\"Fix version\" represents the the first release version where the fix was included in the certification on the 2nd week of UAT and deployed to aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com) for the first time\n• ex: 25.18 is getting certified today and will be deployed this Sunday evening\n\"FixVersion-ST\" represents the release version(s) where we backported the fix after that version was already deployed to aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com)\n• we do these backports to avoid the bug from occurring when we deploy these older release versions to single-tenant AI Hub environments, which are always 1 release version behind aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com)\n    ◦ ex: this past Sunday (5/4), we deployed 25.16.4 to aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com) and 25.14.10 to ST AI Hub environments\n        ▪︎ \nlet’s say this week you backported a fix to both 25.18, 25.16, and 25.14\n        ▪︎ however, your fix was backported after 25.16 and 25.14 were certified on the 2nd week of their UAT’s respectively, so environments currently on 25.16.4 / 25.14.10 don't have your bug fix yet\n        ▪︎ we try to handle this by specifying \"Single-tenant\" labels in release notes - see https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CM9TARK7U/p1732136010552379?thread_ts=1731968189.025249&cid=CM9TARK7U (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CM9TARK7U/p1732136010552379?thread_ts=1731968189.025249&cid=CM9TARK7U)",
