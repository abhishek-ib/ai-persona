      "message": ":wave: Hi all! I'm working on *splitting the UAT and dogfood* *databases.* I'm planning to do the split *next Tuesday* if things go according to plan. This will give plenty of time for working out kinks before the next UAT cycle starts in mid-Oct.\n\nThe goal of the split is to completely isolate the UAT and dogfood databases, and thereby reduce conflicts/corrupted state during UAT.\n\nMore details:\n• I'm planning to clone dogfood's *database* and *S3 buckets*, so that UAT and dogfood will start off mostly identical. \n• After the split, changes made in UAT will not be visible in dogfood and vice-versa.  For example, users added after the split to dogfood *will not* show up in UAT.\n• UAT will use PostgreSQL, whereas dogfood uses Oracle (for reference, production uses MySQL). This will give us coverage of another database backend.\nPlease let me know if you have comments/questions/concerns!",
