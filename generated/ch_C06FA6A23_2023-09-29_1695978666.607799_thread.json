      "message": ":loudspeaker: PSA - we have been facing issues with expiration of the JIRA API credentials use for vulnerability automation that has caused release scans to fail across multiple runs over the last week. We are working with IT to find a permanent fix to restore the credentials. For further details we are posting updates in <#C05TZK5EEJE|>\n\nFor now to mitigate the problem we are going to use personal JIRA API creds to run the automation and generate the vulnerability reports. As a result you will see some of the automation updates come through from Shikhar's JIRA account. The release scanner for today has run. For any questions please use the channel above. cc @Parvez",
