      "message": "The SDK tests don't look like they're actually testing the SDK methods. All the tests are routed through the API instead of the SDK methods. For example, the `manual_upstream_integration` test is directly calling the `run_deployment` API and bypasses the SDK `DeploymentRuns.create()` method altogether. The logic causing this bug improperly stopping the request is inside `DeploymentRuns.create()` that we recommend users call in our docs, so it's entirely missed in our testing.\n\nOverall, we might want to review how these SDK tests are written to ensure they're testing what we expect because all of the tests look to be written in this manner. This could be an isolated instance since most methods do directly call the API, but in the cases where the SDK methods do have additional logic we'll want to make sure those are tested properly.",
