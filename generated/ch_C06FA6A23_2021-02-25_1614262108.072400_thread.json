This is one of the most important priorities for observability team to [1] help surface the data to, [2] identify the bottlenecks in the system using #1.\n\nMy previous comment did not have enough context. To clarify if we can achieve #1 and #2 the natural next step will be to run a set of periodic tests that benchmark performance, identify bottlenecks, and the cause of them.",
