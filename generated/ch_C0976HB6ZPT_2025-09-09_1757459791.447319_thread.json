      "message": "hi @margaret.tomaszczuk @Natasha just a quick question on UI behavior: what is the difference between \"Delete all classes\" and \"Undo schema\"? Currently, undo schema button just deletes the schema and always takes you back to the \"Autogenerate schema\" view with the autogenerate button. And the delete all classes just deletes all the classes in the view but keeps you in the manually generate schema page. Is this expected behavior, or do we expect user to be sent back to autogenerate button view after they delete all classes as well?\n\nBefore, we had the regenerate button instead of undo which allowed user to autogenerate a new schema on the spot.\ncc @Serena @Weiming Wu",
