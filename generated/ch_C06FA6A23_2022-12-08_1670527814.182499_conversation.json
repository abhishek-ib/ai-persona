Amazon RDS will also drop support for MySQL 5.7 on the same date (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/upgrading-from-amazon-rds-for-mysql-version-5-5/#:~:text=MySQL%205.7%20%E2%80%93%20Community%20end%20of,life%20planned%20until%20April%2C%202026.).\n\nWe should also start having conversations with customers who are on MySQL 5.7 and see if they plan to upgrade before the EOL. We should let them know that Instabase is compatible with the next version (MySQL 8.0) and above, and encourage them to upgrade.\n\nPlease reach out to me if you have questions.",
