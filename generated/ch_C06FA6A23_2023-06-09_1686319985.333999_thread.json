      "message": "Happy Friday Engineering team! Wanted to give two specific areas of kudos from a 23.01 training session we gave to the Bank of America annotation team this week:\n\n*Inline Editing/Lasso (Flow Review)*: \"instant zoom to the field in question on the page will definitely make the team more productive\"\n\n*Annotation Analysis:* \"this will REALLY help us especially on documents and fields that are newer to DII (Doc Imaging and Indexing Team), we need to do this on all of our models\"\n\nThanks for making such awesome features for us to demonstrate to our end users!",

      "message": "@Kenny G for the inline editing/lassoing did you feel that BoA found the most value in the zooming in onto the field versus the inline editor itself?\n\nCurrently, the instant zooming into the field is only enabled with inline editor, but if users find this to be a time saver, it would make sense to have it always enabled with or without the inline editor popup.",

Zooming helps especially on the example I'm attaching here - poor quality for the engine, but \"autozoom\" for the operator cuts down on clicks and time. HTH!",
