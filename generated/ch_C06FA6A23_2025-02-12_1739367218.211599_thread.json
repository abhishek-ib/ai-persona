      "message": "Hey team, Here’s an update regarding the feedback provided by @mfichman.\nThe issues mentioned were caused by scanning files that weren’t part of the services, such as test and generated files for Procto. To address this, we’ve updated our global configuration with the appropriate exclusion and inclusion properties. You can find the relevant PR below.\nRegarding code coverage, we’ve modified our quality check to run over the entire codebase instead of just new code. This can be adjusted later, as we are still in the trial phase.\n\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67758\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67812\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67758",

This is currently disable in our system.\n2. *Running code coverage on master*: On every scan of the base repository code coverage is calculated. This is set to 60% in our new configuration. \nDrawbacks:\n• Right now there is no way for us to define different checks for a single project\n• We are considering dividing our whole repo into multiple project, this will give us the ability to add different quality gates.",
