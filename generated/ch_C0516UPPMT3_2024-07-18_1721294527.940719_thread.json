We could develop a feature allowing individual users to create personalised profiles and enabling Admins to create organisation-level profiles. Enhancing interactions based on individual roles and organisational context, including industry-specific terminology and phrases.\n\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2495",
