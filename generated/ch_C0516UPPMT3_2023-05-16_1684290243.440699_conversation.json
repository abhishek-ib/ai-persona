      "message": "Hi Folks, we have enabled billing on aihub.uat.instabase.com (http://aihub.uat.instabase.com).  As a result of this change, you might not be able to Build, Converse, or run Apps until you purchase Credits.  The process to purchasing Credits is fairly simple:\n• Navigate to: https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/billing/payments\n• Click on “Buy Units”.  This should bring up the “Buy Units” modal.\n• In the Units to buy, fill in a large number so that your Credits don’t get used up quickly: 50K is a good number.\n• Click on Proceed to payment details.  This will redirect you to checkout.stripe.com (http://checkout.stripe.com).\n• In the checkout page:\n    ◦ Use the following card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242\n    ◦ Fill in the other details: might be random, but must pass basic validation\n    ◦ Click Pay\n• This should redirect you back to the aihub.uat page, and you should see an increase in your credits.\nPlease let us know if you run into any issues with this.",
