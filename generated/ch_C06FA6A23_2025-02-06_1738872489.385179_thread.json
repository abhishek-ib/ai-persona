      "message": "Hi all, I just submitted a PR (pull/67794 (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67794)), but I'm seeing an issue with missing code coverage. Not sure how it's 0% but when I click on it it shows a bunch of `.tsx` files as missing coverage which I haven't touched in my PR. I'm guessing this is because I only made backend changes which didn't cause any FE tests to run, but coverage is still being measured against React files? Would anyone be able to clarify why I'm seeing this failed check?",
