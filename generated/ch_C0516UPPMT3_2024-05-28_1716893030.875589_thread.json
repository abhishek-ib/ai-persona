      "message": "Also overall, the movement process is quite difficult and prone to error. Since after you move the field, you have to relocate to the new position where you can move the field from. This leads to a slow process when you need to move a fields more than 1/2 locations. Can we make this process a drag and drop to avoid this issue?",
