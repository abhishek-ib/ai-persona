Cons are that it expands the size of the response, but that’s not really a huge deal since these logs will be quite small, and the number of records we process with errors are relatively small. @shaunak if he has any comments on this approach of storing more information in RefinedPhrases (runtime error information) and if that has any negative impact on ReviewDoc",

For example, Refiner UI can show custom logs per cell execution, where as Apply UDF shows logs for that entire function execution. Different steps might want to organize their logs differently (for example it’s really helpful to look at logs in Refiner on a per-cell basis, where as other steps may not have this concept)",
