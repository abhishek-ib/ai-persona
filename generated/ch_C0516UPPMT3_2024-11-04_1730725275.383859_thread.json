      "message": "Hi @Anant. Yes. We do that as a first step. Sometimes, if you ask the LLM for a list of medical exams, that must belong to a list of 5,000 allowed exams, some of them will be read incorrectly, or will not be an exact match, for many reasons. In that case, we would do what is second best, use fuzzy matching to find which exams in the list are the most similar, and show the analyst the 5 ones with the highest similarity score, so they can pick the best one. The same happens in property registration documents, or legal documents, where you want to match the names of people, with small differences (like abbreviations) between two documents.",
