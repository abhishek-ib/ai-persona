Is there a separate desktop site?! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nCan we update this message to indicate that this site should be opened using a desktop/laptop? As an example: `To try AI Hub for free, please visit this site on your desktop or laptop. Mobile support is coming soon!`\n\nBTW: great to see this mobile version. Every feature is nicely disabled!",
