      "message": "Hi all, another PSA. Now that two of the four webservices have been deleted, I did a huge cleanup (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/66209) to all our server-nginx configmaps to remove all the special cases and routing we had to api-server-apps, apps-server, api-server, webapp, along with if/else statements for Saas and AI Hub and more. There should be plenty of time for it to bake on master since 24.50 is already cut. I did some basic testing, but given how many special cases I deleted, it wasn't possible to test each route. If anyone notices any new unexpected 504 errors please let me know, it's likely due to this cleanup patch.",
