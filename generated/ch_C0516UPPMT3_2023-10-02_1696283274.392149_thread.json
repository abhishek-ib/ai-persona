      "message": "It looks from the other thread that there was an actual bug in generating flow without the form recognizer setting.\n\nI also tried this without the multi-page tables setting and it worked quite well. I thought it might work without that feature because these docs are pretty short, and I'm pretty sure they fit in the LLM context window. The multi-page table feature is more for longer docs that don't fit in the context window.\n\nHere is my sample prompt (`Extract the materials list as a table and return as markdown`) and it looks like it extracted all the tables correctly. This is tested on aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com (http://aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com).\n\nIt does seem to have some trouble with OCR of the numbers if the first column (which is a separate issue)",
