I know we have major sandbox instances but curious if we have a shared s3 bucket across them that i could use the flow api to kick off the job to get the results from 22.01 / 5 / 8 / 10 etc",

You can add your tests to this drive and test on the respective releases. You can either set up a regression test which will run as part of our regular golden runs through jenkins, or you can create a test suite and manually trigger them every time using the Test Runner (https://dogfood.instabase.com/apps/test-runner/) App.\n\nHere are the docs for Test Runner https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/apps/test-runner/. We have a PR in review which updates this and it should be merged very soon.",
