      "message": "Hey team,\nWe are deploying a new version of Admiral for sandboxes soon that adds a field to the deployment creation dialog in Admiral to include the Customer/Installation of each deployment. For internal environments, this maps to Division/Team.\nWe have created an initial set of Division/Teams, but if you don't see your team, please reach out and we can create it for you. In the mean time if you need to deploy without delay select `Instabase` and `Internal`\nOtherwise when creating a new sandbox please select your division/team, for example, `Engineering` and `Tech Infra` as shown below.\nWe'll soon reconcile the existing sandboxes to be under the correct teams instead of internal and will update once that is complete.",
