This is just phase one of the project, and from what I've gathered it ideally needs to be in by January of 2022:\n\n1. An authentication document is requested of a User\n2. User uploads the document through Courier, C1's web portal (government issued ID, SS4 letter, bank statement)\n3. Courier calls Instabase via API with that single document (or document packet, in the case of multiple bank statements)\n4. Instabase ONLY classifies the document (eg \"is this a drivers license?\")\n5. Based on classification validation, call sent back to Courier with one of two actions:\n6a. Document matches what is expected, User may continue\n6b. Information is incorrect or unexpected, User prompted to correct\n\nMore discovery is needed, but wanted to close the loop on at least the initial use-case scope.",
