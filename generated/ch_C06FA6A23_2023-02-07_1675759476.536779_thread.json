What’s your experience been?",

I am a dumb vim user with a primitive setup and work on a single screen without a desk setup.\n\nMore seriously, telling machines to do something for you could be as hard as doing it yourself because you have to elaborate all the specs. You can tell AI to generate code that \"adds two integers together and return the results\". But what integer? int8, int32, or uint32, or a long int, or you want a unbounded integer type to avoid overflow? This'd require context and decision making by the engineers.\n\nI am not disagreeing that these tools boost our productivity to some extent, but the true expert knows where/when/how things may fail and how to deal with it. In another post, Andrew Ng actually pointed out that the answers generated by ChatGPT could be subject to being overly confident, and we just see similar things here in generated code.",
