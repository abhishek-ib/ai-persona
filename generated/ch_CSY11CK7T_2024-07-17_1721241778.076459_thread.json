      "message": "Question about code organization...\n\nI have an entity for groups in apps/aihub. I need to allow the IBUserMultiSelect in Lib/IBUserMultiSelect to select groups as well. This means that I'll need to import types from apps/aihub/entities/groups.\n\nI think the issue here is that because we've split up aihub, aihub-mobile, aihub-billing, and aihub-admin versus using an \"apps\" folder within \"aihub\", we have to use Lib to share code between them versus using shared, entities, store, features, etc.\n\nIf we want to do this right, it seems like we have three choices:\n1. Move aihub-mobile, aihub-billing, and aihub-admin to be inside the aihub folder, making it so that we don't have to use Lib anymore\n2. Replicate the new code organization structure inside of Lib/aihub and move a lot of code (for example, my groups entity) inside it\n3. Move most code from shared, entities, store, and features inside of Lib so we aren't splitting code between two places",

I think we can move aihub-billing into aihub but the other two are better to be separated: aihub-admin and aihub-mobile are not needed for regular web-based aihub users.\n\nI'd prefer #2. Because we don't want to move aihub-admin and aihub-mobile into aihub folder, things in Lib/aihub are shared among aihub, aihub-admin, and aihub-mobile, whereas things in aihub are only used in aihub folder.",
