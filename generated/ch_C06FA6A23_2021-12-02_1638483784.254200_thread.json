      "message": "Hi all — I am creating a new control plane based sandbox pipeline for development, non-LITE sandboxes (sandboxes used for POVs, active development, demos, etc - notably not for testing specific changes, which don’t require a fully resourced environment). We want to make sure that these sandboxes are reliable and stable to hold up for active development and POVs. I have prepared a resourcing sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N5f4L94mLCNHIwxp3zLDwepfCEY4qI724Jbf1pD2ipg/edit#gid=0) for this. *Can you all please take a look at the resources for your services to ensure these sandboxes are appropriately provisioned for these use cases?*\n\nI will use these values to prepare config patches for all the services. Since these sandboxes will be orchestrated by the control plane, they *will not* use the configuration values in the codebase’s deployment-config.json files. I’m also working on preparing the requisite config patches to ensure they are configured correctly by default.\n\ncc @shaunak @sudeep @Heymian @Kerry @lydia @Hari @Jessica",
