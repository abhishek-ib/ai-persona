      "message": "Anything third-party is always a security risk - be it UDF, be it Recipe Book. As of now, since we run those in the same Instabase Context (cluster, network, domain-cookie, etc.) is a security sin. Given that as of now these are first-party or second party -- it's fine. As soon as we go third-party -- we are exposing ourselves to big risks. We'll have to invest in Capability Permission Matrix per User -- a common technique used by all OSes where all third-party stuff runs in a separate context and access to the OS stuff is provided by the explicit approval for each capability (for example: FS Access, DB Access, App X access, All Access) by the user. It's like this app wants to access Camera, do you allow it? We'll have to rewrite the whole thing. Neither the current recipe book, nor the UDF architecture will work when we have third-party writing apps. The reason why we did both was mainly to test if there is feasibility of that kind of artifact.",
