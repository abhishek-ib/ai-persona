Matt and the team have developed a SolEng chatbot designed to include all the information which we typically share with Solution Engineers during onboarding or project ramp-up. The chat history from all users will help us improve the botâ€™s performance by enriching it with sources that can better address common questions.",

Reviewing user conversations was a critical way of identifying problem points for users, optimizing user experiences and also uncovering additional use cases for chatbots based on how the bot was used. For example, we'd frequently find users asking the bot to do something it wasn't designed to handle. This was great signal to build a new skill for the bot. There's a similar use case here where if a question about a knowledge base is continually asked, but not answered sufficiently it's a good signal to end users there is a gap in the knowledge base that needs to be addressed.",
