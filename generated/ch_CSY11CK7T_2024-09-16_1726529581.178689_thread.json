      "message": "Hi,\nI’m currently trying to run an app from my local aihub setup and have set the AWS configs correctly. All services are up and running without any errors.\nHowever, I’m unable to upload any files on the app’s run page, as I keep getting an “Unsupported file extension” error. I’ve noticed there are no API calls in the network tab, and there are no errors in the api-server or file-service logs. Can someone help me with debugging this, or let me know if I might be missing something?\nThank you!",
