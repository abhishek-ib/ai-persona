      "message": "Search seems to have quite some difficulty figuring out what I mean when asking about what field types are available when creating automation apps. Fair enough, the first version of the question was a bit vague and perhaps Search doesn’t know about the term “automation app” yet, but follow ups and even specifically asking about fields available when _creating_ projects and apps, and giving examples of field types, yielded nothing useful.\n\nPerhaps most confusingly, not a single documentation source was referenced. We do have a drive called *AI Hub Docs* connected in the workspace, and when I browse the contents of the drive, it seems pretty up to date and contains the _Creating apps_ article which answers the question handily (https://docs.instabase.com/apps/create#editing-fields).  IMO documentation should be treated as a pretty primary source.",
