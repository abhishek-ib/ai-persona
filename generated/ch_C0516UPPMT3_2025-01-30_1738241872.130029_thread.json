      "message": "Hey, I find that the UI for exposing classification confidence is very hidden. Most users don't know there is a confidence for this, or struggle to find it in my experience.\n\nThe main issues with it are:\n1. Confidence value is hidden in an unintuitive place (behind the 3 dots)\n    a. It makes more sense to me to surface it at the top level next to the assigned class in the same pane where we add fields\n2. You can only see confidence of 'Other' docs if you go via the 3 dots in another class\n    a. This is because there are no 3 dots for the other class",
