I want to eventually get to a state where I can run PDB on api-server and debug something.\n\nMy crafting sandbox is https://https--jagjeetwani-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/\nHowever, I noticed Udit's is a different format: https://crafting-aihub--udit-dev-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/\n\nI can't use the shared crafting logins on my sandbox, but it works on Udit's. Is there a reason why?",
