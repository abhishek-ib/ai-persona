      "message": "So I dig deep into this,\nThe issue is with emulation of rabbitmq-3.11 version, its *not* supported on mac neither using qemu (default docker emulation) or rosetta (new docker emulation), got error building with both, similar is a case for some elastic search link (https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5123). Even tried upgrading to latest docker-desktop version which is supposed to fix these kind of issues. I see 2 solutions for this:\n• Use arm64 image, that is we create a container-base image with arm64 and use that for local development, tried this, seems to be working.\n• Use release images for local development (can share commands for this)",

      "message": "@gurkirat thanks for digging further, while i am not an expert at m1 builds/emulation - the image falls into class of problems where i would consider building locally is not an option. As a result my first suggestion would be to use remote build via crafting.dev (http://crafting.dev) that Sean has been working on. If that is not feasible we can ask folks to use the certified images. We should also update this in local dev env doc as well",
