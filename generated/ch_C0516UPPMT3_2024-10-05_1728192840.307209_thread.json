      "message": "Hey, had a workshop session around the Human Review process on AI Hub with ANZ. The conclusion from their team was they want to explore building their own HR or recreating ours in their own systems due to various factors. Here is some of the feedback I managed to write down:\n1. They would like to have different optionality and customisability both across workspaces (different use cases) and different users (e.g. Jack likes things one way and Sally another)\n2. Some reviewers should be blocked from editing some parts of the docs. They should only have permission to alter some fields that they are qualified to assess\n3. Reviewers should only have permission to assess certain types of docs (e.g. bank statements but not payslips) - I think this ones on the roadmap?\n4. They should be able to \"escalate\" some fields/docs? If they are qualified but unsure, they'd like a second round of review to be possible with a manager or something",
