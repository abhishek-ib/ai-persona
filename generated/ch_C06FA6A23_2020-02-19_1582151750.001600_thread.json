A user at BofA is attempting to use a PDF file as input, OCR the doc, then (somehow?) regenerate the PDF but now with searchable text vs. being an “image” PDF. But keep the PDF “intact”, in terms of what it looks like. That sounds like… _not_ something we can do, currently? Just double-checking that is true before I let him down gently.",
