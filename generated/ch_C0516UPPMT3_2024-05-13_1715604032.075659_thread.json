      "message": "Hey, for spreadsheet view in Build I think it would be useful to see both the cell by cell view as well as the original formatting. In this example, when I upload the sheet to AI Hub I end up checking the extraction results with the original doc outside of AI Hub because the internal view doesn't make it easy to see formatting (high friction for development).\n\nI think it would be more useful to have an option to switch view (like we have with normal docs to change between PDF view and OCR view) to switch between the 2 views.",

I think in general, the purpose of displaying the doc to a user inside Build is to allow them to check if extractions are correct and to easily compare and locate data. If we lose the formatting of the original file (colour, bold lines, font size etc) then this becomes really hard",
