As it stands it takes 3 clicks on buttons that say ‘external storage’ before the user finds out that it means S3.

In this case, we both agree that this should be improved -- at the minimum, consistency is missing here (inconsistent use of button and text as links for the same kind of action -- for a user, it's all about adding files to a project).\n\nGoing forward though we should have a planned product release schedule, and should not push adhoc changes often anymore (even if they are good changes).",
