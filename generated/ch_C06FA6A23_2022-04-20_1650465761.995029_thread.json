      "message": "Hey team,\n\nWe are going to *upgrade the instabase version in `Rocket - PoV sandbox`* from 22.01. We are deciding between upgrading to `22.03` or `22.04`. My concern is if there any fixes for the bugs which are not cherrypicked or fixed in either of the releases, that would increase the back and forth.\n\n1. `Encrypted pdf` error in process files step: Ticket (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/FLOW-2456) - @upendra can you confirm if it’s fixed in both 22.03 and 22.04?\n2. `Display Suggestions` error: Thread link (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C02KS5FHZEE/p1650302898710089)  - @Serena I see the PR but could you confirm if the fix is in 22.04?\n3. `No ocr text in apply checkpoint`: Thread link (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CV8V33RPV/p1650379873383909) - @Kerry I feel this is yet to be fixed in 22.04, but was this working fine in 22.03?\n4. `Distinguishing between validation error and flow` error: Thread link (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CV8V33RPV/p1646760956803229?thread_ts=1646727700.295779&cid=CV8V33RPV) - @Adam, could you confirm if the fix should be present in both 22.03 and 22.04?\n5. `Double Annotation in ML Studio` issue - Thread link (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C02KS5FHZEE/p1649088540933279?thread_ts=1648117698.988769&cid=C02KS5FHZEE) - @Serena, I guess the fix was cherry picked to 22.03 as well?\nI tagged the folks I feel were directly involved in helping with the fixes, if that’s not the case, please add the relevant person and help us get a confirmation on the same.\n\nThanks!\n\ncc. @Dale DeLoy @Matt Weaver",
