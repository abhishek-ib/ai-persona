TLDR: All files that are uploaded/written are asynchronously indexed to ElasticSearch and are searchable. You can also add custom attributes to the document index (in addition to core attributes like filename, size), and upload files with custom metadata via API. Docs for using the search API are here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase-docs/pull/319/files). Feel free to let me or <!subteam^S01DXHX6FPT> know if you have any questions! Happy searching :blush: :mag:",
