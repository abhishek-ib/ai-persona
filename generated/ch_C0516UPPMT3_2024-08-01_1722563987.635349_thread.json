      "message": "Hey team, had a second check-in with ISB who we are running a POC with. They had some additional feedback points on the platform (but in general they have loved it):\n1. Upstream integration with Sharepoint would be a major uplift. They are a \"heavy Microsoft, Azure, Teams company\" and so streamlining the ability to get docs/data in AI Hub from Sharepoint would be significant. \n2. They have a long-term need to see unit costs associated with individual batch runs. Their motivation is that they want to offer optionality to customers in some cases (e.g. you can have an operations person or IB process your files). As such, they need to understand associated costs well so they can provide this information.\n    a. Is this currently possible via API or is this completely hidden from the user? \n    b. Is there any workaround they can use for their short-term needs? This is useful so they can estimate consumption from their internal tests rather than average doc calculations\n3. They were surprised that a single validation failure would cause all documents in a batch to be sent for review (they thought this was a bug). I know we are bringing more optionality here, so just another data point!\n4. Case management + cross-doc validation would be huge for them. They have use cases where they receive multiple pieces of ID and need to verify that details match across case documents\ncc @Nico",
