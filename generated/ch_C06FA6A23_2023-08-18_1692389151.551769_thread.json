I can't use ctrl+D to bookmark instabase.com/docs/ (http://instabase.com/docs/) because it will redirect to https://instabase.com/docs/23.07 (I still can manually add it to my bookmark).\nFor example, can we add a page instabase.com/docs/latest (http://instabase.com/docs/latest) that directly renders the latest doc?",

It will be saved as  instabase.com/docs/23.07/ (http://instabase.com/docs/23.07/)\n3. in a few months, I click the bookmark to go to the API doc, it will bring me back to instabase.com/docs/23.07/ (http://instabase.com/docs/23.07/), but not the latest version (say 23.10).\nSo, I wonder if we can have a stable instabase.com/docs/latest (http://instabase.com/docs/latest) that won't redirect users to instabase.com/docs/23.07/ (http://instabase.com/docs/23.07/), rather, it just renders the same content as instabase.com/docs/23.07/ (http://instabase.com/docs/23.07/).",
