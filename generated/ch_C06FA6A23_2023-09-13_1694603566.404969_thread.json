      "message": ":alarm::alarm::alarm::alarm:IB FLOW PARSER:alarm::alarm::alarm::alarm:\nTeam, happy to announce we have published 0.0.1 of the ibflowpaser (https://github.com/instabase/flow-parser) under an MIT license to leverage within our customers environments for solution development and troubleshooting.  This is an simple utility that takes flow log, parses each steps and groups them by the input records themselves. Give it a shot and provide feedback or bugs. I was able to find logs throughout different versions of IB but there will be edge cases.\nhttps://github.com/instabase/flow-parser",

Secondly, I presume this only works against JSON logs and not CSV logs?
