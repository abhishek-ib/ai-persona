Just thinking about potential ways to expand capabilities in AIHub.\n\nA capability like this would be helpful in use cases where understanding a document requires accessing complex information stored externally. Instead of just extracting the information we can allow a user to define an input document, reference documents and a task to surface more actionable insights for any given document.\n\nI'm working on a PFR. The demo was built using a chatbot but I think there's a related use case in Build to automate the insights.",
