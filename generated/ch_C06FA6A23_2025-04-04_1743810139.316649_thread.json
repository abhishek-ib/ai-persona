Oddly the (nearly) identical configs and versions on Prod Jenkins work fine - so I think a security patch I included is perhaps the culprit.\n\nThat said, I'm not at all confident that I'll be able to get the new PreProd Jenkins instance to a good and stable spot (and resync'd, and revalidated) inside the next 90 minutes. :lolcry:\n\nSo! Have a lovely weekend, I'll get as much of this fixed up as I can this weekend, and we'll slate a new cutover date soon! (And hopefully you'll all forgive me for the 'hype train --> crashed train' ride I brought you on this week! :meow_this_is_fine: )",
