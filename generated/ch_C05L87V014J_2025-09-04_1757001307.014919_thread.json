After removing them, the build_protos script started throwing file not found errors when trying to build the python generated files. Assuming these files are not needed anymore, here's (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/74353) a PR to remove the logic to update sentinels completely to stop getting the error while building protos. @mfichman Can you take a look at the PR?",
