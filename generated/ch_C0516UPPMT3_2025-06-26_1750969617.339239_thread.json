      "message": "Wanted to confirm my understanding on a topic: does the way we pick out relevant chunks for reasoning/search apply to multiple documents across Analyse too and will it limit being able to get summaries over information for more than 3 documents?\n\nContext: customer has a set of questionnaire responses that they want to get answer trends across. We currently have a set of 10, but we should be getting more. If we put analysis questions into Converse with those 10 samples, am I correct in understanding in this situation that we wouldnâ€™t be able to provide a summary influenced by all 10 samples without preprocessing the work beforehand because we pick the most relevant 3 chunks first?",
