The idea would be that a user sees that same modal with header text and sub-text that is updated for:\n> *Default drive changed: Unable to add new files*\n> You can continue interacting with files already in this conversation. To converse with new files, create a new conversation.\nThe user would then see the explanation of default drive and the only option a user would have is to close the modal. If the user went to update files they would then see the banner in converse.",

For that user, all they need to know is that an org admin changed the default drive, and they can either move their project there or delete it. They don't need a paragraphs of explanation about what a default drive is. As Jean pointed out previously, users understand the concept of _default_ and _drive_.\n\nI'm all for explaining things in the UI when it warrants it, but I think this current modal is overkill given the intended audience. I stand by my recommendation for the Build modal:\n\n*Default drive has changed*\nAn admin changed the default drive for your organization. You must either migrate this project to the new default drive or delete it.\n[Delete project] [Move project]",
