      "message": "Hey Team, Hi,\n\nI’m trying to use the Scheduler app for scheduling the execution of a flow (for a NatWest requirement to extract model performance on a schedule basis). I’ve raised Jira ticket https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/UI-148, but here is the description of the issue and the requests made for usability enhancement:\n\n> _I’m experiencing some UI issues that needs to be fixed:_\n> _1) when selecting the binary, the scheduler modal dialog remains in the foreground, making in impossible to use the file selector modal dialog in the background._\n> _2) same for selecting the input folder._\n> \n> _Now with the should have feature requirements:_\n> _1) my flow is using runtime parameters, there is no field to define these parameters as defined on the Run Flow execution and I think the scheduler app should have one in the option configurations part of the dialog._\n> \n> _And finally with the nice to have requirements:_\n> _1) It would be nice to be able to schedule a flow on a minute basic (5, 10, 15 ..) for development testing purpose, waiting for 1 hour (lowest time interval level is not convenient)_\n> _2) It should be possible to set the time as well as date precisely rather than being stuck with a default option_\nI can’t provide the scheduler app as a solution until it is fixed and enhanced.\nI guess I can schedule the flow using an external client + Flow APIs, but this is a tactical solution.\n\nHas anybody got a better idea until I can use  the Scheduler App as it is supposed to be used?\nScreenshot 2021-07-14 at 17.48.02",

Just in case the apps is in scope for UAT activities , the NatWest use case is a genuine business requirement and would be perfect  to test that feature. But in my opinion, the scheduler app should not be  deployed on prem or even IB.com (http://IB.com) when it is in a broken state and unusable.\n\nHence why I raised the Jira ticket, if the Scheduler App cannot be fixed for the forseeable releases then it should be removed or at least fixed to a minimum viable product version of it.  Either way I need to know what to say to the customer with regards to scheduling with IB, at the moment it is not clear.",

If there are some quick UI issues that can be  fixed to enable use, then it can be worth it (fyi<!subteam^SQC4GLFN2> to chime in on that!). The suggestions for improving the time granularity and config options sound like feature improvements that are things we should definitely consider, but dont’ sound like blockers.",
