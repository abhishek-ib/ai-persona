This has been up since Friday, so just in case the banner isn't being switched to `off`, sharing here that I'm still seeing it as of the time of this post :memo: \n• It may be nice to be able to have a link to some status landing page in the banner to check on the progress/estimated time of completion (if that sort of thing is able to be / is already being calculated)",
