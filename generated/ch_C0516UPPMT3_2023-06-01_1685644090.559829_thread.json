I also expected that if a doc was already uploaded, the system could detect it and present it instantly instead of having to process/load it all over again.\n• In terms of sorting, the thought is a user can query completed docs while the other docs are processing in queue and it would be easier to go through the completed docs if they were sorted to the top vs scrolling through swiss cheese or vs waiting until the whole job is complete. This sorting would be problematic though IF someone loaded their docs in a specific order. AND to your point, the re-ordering MAY be jarring...",
