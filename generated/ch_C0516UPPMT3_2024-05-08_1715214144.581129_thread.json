      "message": "some UI issues I noticed in the Validations tabs:\n• the rules show up out of order once there are 10+ rules, because it’s doing character ordering not numerical ordering (see screenshot)\n• when you click “Add rule” -> “Custom function” (at the top of the rule list) it adds the dropdown at the bottom of the rule list (high friction)\n• once there are a lot of rules (like >10) every step of adding a new rule becomes very slow\nalso echoing something raised by Hamish & Arjun earlier here, that we really need to be able to re-use custom validation functions",
