      "message": "I think the practical reason that we do individual config for each app in v2 is that different teams work on different apps/endpoints and ended up adding their own. Plus we only have a small portion of API endpoints upgraded to v2. At some point we should start looking to consolidate these items in the config file.\n\nWhat were the reasons we decided to route default endpoints in /api/v1 to api-server-apps at the first place? It looks a bit arbitrary to me but it doesn't look like it is hurting anything. Having a default api route seems ok with me, if we have to decide one, it'll probably be either api-server or api-server-apps. Likely the one that includes the majority endpoints should be the default.",
