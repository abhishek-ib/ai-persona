There is a local drive mounted under a repo of this user and it looks like a root path of a linux file system, and it includes a ton of files (e.g. `choitomas66/my-repo/fs/local-mount-1/sys/class/cpuid/cpu2/subsystem/cpu24/subsystem/cpu1/subsystem`) It doesn't look like this is intended and it is causing the file walker to spend lots of cycles on this drive.",
