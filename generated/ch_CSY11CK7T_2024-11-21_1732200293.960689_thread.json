      "message": "@Jag, @Serena\n\n> will it be possible to configure a retention period for all deployments in an environment?\nCurrently, I don’t think this is an env-wide configuration, but we can extend it to include such functionality. As per the scope of this ticket, this feature will delete all associated data for runs and cannot be configured to only clean up the docs table.\n\n> what about old deployments created before the implementation of this feature?\nWill support deleting older deployments as well.\n\n> If this is in the later stages, perf improvements should happen quite soon.\nretention period functionality still needs to be implemented, but bulk deletion of runs is in the later stages jira (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/FLOW-10295)\n\ncc @Anil - please correct If I’m missing something",
