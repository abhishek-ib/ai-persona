      "message": "Hey, do we have plans to apply OCR confidence as a doc level validation? (instead of field level). I think this ticket is the most relevant - https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2809\n\nI tend to find that when OCR confidence is poor in situations when we are always expecting typed (not handwritten) docs, often the whole document has low OCR conf (e.g. blurred photo). Instead of applying OCR conf to each field individually in these cases, it feels much more intuitive to me to apply the validation at the doc level (e.g. average OCR confidence for whole doc is < 90% threshold). I imagine this acting like a bit like classification confidence (but could also be an upstream process I suppose)",
