(more context of their use case here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJaAIRMUNtPYc9MGkq1Pg_lwfaXd_6gt2_Q983cYGk4/edit#heading=h.p3921cc0cevp)) The initial results look very good (see the screenshots). We will take this back to the Dynasty team to validate and try on a larger set of documents.\n\nThere are a lot of things to improve on AI Hub (keep your feedback coming!). This example is a reminder of the massive value we can unlock for potential customers with AI Hub. Looking forward to the diversity of use cases we would see in the coming weeks.\n\nOnwards! :muscle::skin-tone-2:",
