      "message": "I've noticed that the source tracking feature that scrolls to where in the document the extraction was conducted is very temperamental. I've recorded a Loom (https://www.loom.com/share/736a8590b2744026af2792cfa22a698f?sid=81705656-4ecb-49a9-9304-926459789250) that shows this variability in behaviour - refreshing the project 3 times results in 3 different sets of behaviour. When the feature works properly, repeatedly clicking different fields seems to break it.\n\nFYI, I love this feature, it's incredibly useful for demos when its working :grinning:",
