We can use a postflow UDF at the end of the flow to check if the file 1) has been reviewed (straight-through or not) and 2) if reviewed, what’s the changes made by comparing the output of the checkpoint step with the refiner or classifier step. For the STP files to find out `if there are actually of high quality` they need to have the operators to randomly check a few and see.",
