I'd suggest looking in `shared-utils/test-utils/src/test-cmds-py-unit.json` and changing the command invoked for the relevant test(s). In _theory_ changing it from `make bazel-build bazel-test` to something that runs python-native tooling instead... should work. :joy:\n\nSomething like cerlery/app-tasks' `make clean build run-test-local` or similar might or might not work, but might be a start to try out",
