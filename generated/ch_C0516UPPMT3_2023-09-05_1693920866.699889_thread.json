      "message": "Hey all, a temporarily workaround before the fix is shipped to prod next Tuesday is to add a Combine step before your Refiner step. Combine step in this case serves as a no-op (since there's no branches to combine) but it forces a stage boundary and therefore all files will be flushed to the disk before the Refiner step runs, eliminating the file not found issue.\n\n@lydia can you update the thread here when the fix is out? I'm also curious why we haven't caught this before. Do we have any golden test that uses the new ibllm Refiner package?",
