If yes, can someone point me to it? If not, I tried to make a list here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDoyV28ibBB1lCG2kl42MSaFp3INU_gTtBF1hgItvEk/edit?usp=sharing) it would be great if someone can review and ensure that this is correct and updated to the current release?\n\nThis would be important as HSBC’s new process requires us to provide license information for scans prior to them being approved for use and this repository will help to gather information without delay. Let me know if this needs to go to a different team/channel?\n\ncc: @shaunak @sudeep @kunal @Heymian",
