      "message": "@Kaustubh (KD) I think the ticket you posted might be related but not exactly the feature needed.\n\nWe need a solution for the following type of scenario (example):\n\n1. AI Hub Build App extracts a list of unstructured diagnosis descriptions from a medical report document\n2. For each diagnosis we need to match the closest ICD-10 codes \n    a. *Context:* To standardise diagnosis doctors use *I*nternational *C*odes For *D*esease; Insurances also need the code for processing of claims \n    b. *Complication:* Thousands of ICD Codes exist and cannot be put into a cleaning prompt in AI Hub Build\n    c. *Resolution:* AI Hub build needs a mechanism to find closest matches in large lists of mapping data for extracted data points. That's what @Hari and I were referring to I think.\nAgain, this is just one out of many examples. Another common one might be the matching of an incoming Table Header to a list of potential output header names.",
