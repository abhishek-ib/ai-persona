      "message": "Hello~ I have some feedback on the new granular usage page. cc @Josh Rad as you’re assigned EPD-2318 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2318)\n• _Green circles:_ These categories (Build, Run, Converse) don’t match the categories used elsewhere on the page (Automation project, Automation app, Conversation). \n• _Purple circles:_  Minor polish--the date picker widget is a bit cut off, I think there might be room to increase its width just a bit so the full date range is visible.\n• _Blue circle:_ We don’t indicate the date for usage bars not on a marker line. I just have to infer by counting between the marked dates. I think it would improve clarity to be able to see the date in the hover card, especially for chart views that have a much wider date range like YTD.\n• I also wonder if maybe we could/should set a max height for the table that lists consumption unit events, and have a scroll bar within that table, rather than having the entire page scroll through thousands and thousands of consumption event results (e.g. right now in _All time_ view I can scroll through 17,000+ events, which is a very long table and very long page).",
