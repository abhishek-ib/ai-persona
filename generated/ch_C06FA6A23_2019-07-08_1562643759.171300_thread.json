      "message": ":wave: hiyo! Not sure where to put this — we have a solutions architect candidate who wanted to demo Instabase to us as part of his interview. He’s got a UDF he’s working on but is getting an error saying he doesn’t have rights to execute custom scripts. Is that something we need to turn on for new accounts? Or is there a broader permissions concern there? His username is *jackingoldsby* if it’s simple to give him the right permissions. If it’s not simple, that’s fine too; he says he’s fine to explain what ought to happen during the demo, but figured I’d check and see if there was a simple fix first.",
