      "message": "Hi team, something I've noticed in Converse - it seems like multi-doc queries and single-doc queries often return different responses. For example, when included as a part of the multi-doc query, governing law for GXO Logistics can't be found. When you single out the doc, however, New York is found as governing law. I've seen this with other examples too. Maybe it's because these documents are on the longer side (137, 63, 155 pages each)?",

      "message": "The more documents you include in a RAG context, the more “chunks” you need to consider for answering the query. So likely with more potential chunks it might make mistakes in the ranking of chunks and so the chunk containing the right answer might be lower-ranked and not presented as context to the LLM :confused: Again thorough debugging would help in this instance to understand it better, but above is my hypothesis.",

I can try Research mode, but having a way to ensure more consistency across multi- and single-doc queries would be great for the confidence of our users",
