In chat feedback - in addition to thumb up and down, for negative feedback we ask people to pick from options on what the problem was. Users can also provide qualitative feedback. All of this is captured in the chats.json file and can be mined for improvement. (screenshot attached) \n2. We also have a generic google form to capture overall feedback from the users. \nBoth of these can be used to improve the product and model dev performance.",
