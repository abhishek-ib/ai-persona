Would love to chat and help facilitate, but for Goldman we really need to lock down @Jesika Haria,  @Aaron Vontell , @Kerry and my time as much as possible to ensure this deliverable gets met. It's a lot of Refiner column writing / management (~150 columns in total) + new features coming in with provenance tracking\n\nIf we could limit at-mentions, I will personally strive to only check things once every 2 hours / ideally as infrequently as possible.\n\nCurrently it's a bit challenging to have that long focused period of time to get this work done.\n\nWill greatly appreciate it, thank you. And thank you team + Kerry, Jesika, Aaron for all the extremely helpful and fantastic work",
