      "message": "I have a Converse use case where I have imported multiple documents (they are screenshots of data from a mobile device). The screenshots show readings from a device along with date/time. The data spans all the pages. In total there are 34 entries of data spread across the 6 pages of data. I have been using this to play around with multi-doc and multi-step. I have had challenges with a variety of things. I've attached some examples:\n• When asking to create a table of the extracted information, I get an error that there are no tables on the documents. \n• A few situations where I a variation of \"The response is incorrect...\" and then it gives a lot of details. Failing to filter specific items in a table. \n• In one instance, it says \"The response is incorrect....\" but then said the \"The correct response should look like this....\" This was confusing. \n• I asked it to summarize the number of type of reading and it calculated it correctly. When I asked for it to create a pie chart, it only captured 3 instances of each (should have been 10, 10, 14)\nFiles attached.",
