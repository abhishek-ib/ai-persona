I am thinking we might have something through ICC that would be a programatic representation of what is on the status page. Does that make sense? Thanks in advance. cc @Daniel Campo",

If we provided an API that reflected exactly what the platform status is at every point in time, allowing them to poll our platform - I can imagine a scenario where we would get a lot of potentially false negatives or flakiness.\n\nBetter to leave monitoring and alerting to on call and alert/notify the customer when there is a true degradation rather than giving the customer free reign on polling our platform for this",
