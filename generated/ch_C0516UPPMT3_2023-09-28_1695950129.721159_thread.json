Asking for extract all checkboxes actually seems to perform pretty well but without the accompanying questions. Asking in context - really difficult to the level it seems to be guessing. Some screenshots here and file.",

And it is ok to have some back and forth as I’m clearly going to use this automation for hundreds of docs, so spending a bit of time is fine. Ideally you have some back prompts from Instabase that validate what you like to do. Something that could be achieved with consistent provenance tracking. When asking for an advanced feature like a checkbox or table, the system should respond with something like:\n\n “Seems like you want to detect check boxes - this what I see on this page (show provenance track space including the yes / no options), do I have that right? Then allows me to make corrections if necessary, or just go ahead. \n\nThe go ahead with confirming the field",
