      "message": "Some search feedback in light of our all hands convo today:\n1. The Sources section at the bottom of the answer works, but the dropdown for sources next to answers doesn't (404 error). Recording attached\n2. I personally find it really difficult to navigate Jira ticket search, so that would personally be the biggest value add in search for me.\n3. I do get this error (SS attached) often using Search more than I get other errors using Chat or Build, which is a minus in my experience as a user\n4. Taking @Jasperâ€™s advice, I looked up a technical integration question I had for a prospect in Search and it did give me very useful information. I will definitely be using it more for that purpose. Two things about this search, though:\n    a. As a user, I love getting the sources but I don't want to open up 9 different documents and scroll through them to see where it got the information from. Some indication of pages or chunks where the information from would be nice, and I think the sources list can be presented in a more user friendly way - I think the dropdown is a step in the right direction, but indicating which part of the answer each source is associated with in the master sources list would be huge.\n    b. After I got the error I mentioned in #3, every time I navigate to that Search project the page blanks out. The only option I have at that point is to refresh the page. Attaching a recording for this too",
