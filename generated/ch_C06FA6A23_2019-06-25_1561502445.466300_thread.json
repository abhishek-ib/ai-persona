      "message": "As I’m going through setting up a local dev environment, I noticed that the docs state we’re on `go 1.11`, with a note that `1.12` is explicitly not supported. Is that still true, and if so, is there any interest in a pull request to support `1.12` (whatever that entails - I haven’t even started looking)? Or is this something that is in the works/has been looked at already/is none of my business go away? I ask as that seems like a decent way to learn the ins-and-outs of building the codebase, the PR process for non-trivial things, testing, the CI/CD pipeline, etc.",

So we would have to update all our go.sum files and also force everyone to upgrade their local install.",
