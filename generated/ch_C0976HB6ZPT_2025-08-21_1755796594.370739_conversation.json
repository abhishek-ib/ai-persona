      "message": "Hey team, for visibility on the not-persisted provenance bug - Merged the fix PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/73813) and tested on sandbox and provenance is now persisted for apps that contain clean lines and/or udf/derived fields. Backports for 25.32 and 25.34 are up as well. I've attached the example of an old app run that didn't have provenance and a run of the same app after the fix was deployed. The issue here arose because clean lines in an app meant refiner was run after, and when the refiner program read the docai-generated fields from the ibmsg, it didn't copy over the image provenance. Persisting the image provenance made the bounding boxes show up again.",
