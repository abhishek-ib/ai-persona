      "message": "answering by bullet point in your message\n• we are changing this in 23.49! you can try out the new UI on aihub-sandbox.internal\n• yeah, the new UI will make this a bit better\n    ◦ in the current UI on prod, the initial suggested class name is just the first class suggestion, which could have been generated from any document in the project\n    ◦ in the new UI, we won’t automatically select the first suggestion. Instead, you will either type a class name or select a suggestion (please try out on aihub-sandbox.internal!)\n• i don’t think there are changes planned for this - can you explain what you would expect to happen if classification hasn’t run yet?",
