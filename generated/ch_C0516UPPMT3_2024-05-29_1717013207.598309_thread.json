      "message": "Done a number of demos with insurers now on both claims and U/W use cases. Generally feedback on Build, Chat, and Converse is great. But to make it really powerful as an assistant it needs to come together. \n\nLive example - Nationwide is evaluating us for a claims coverage use case. Ideally the adjuster has the Build Output centrally in the screen with all the standard questions they want answered.\n\nBut is then able to query the same set of documents in Converse from the same window. Or ask a question to their chatbot on guidelines from the same window. They really work together for many use cases.\n\nBuild gets a lot of the standard stuff out in an automated flow whereas Converse and Chat allow for further querying on exceptions or anything that stands out cc @Kyra Harney",

I put a rough doc together a while ago but haven't had a chance to build on it yet, will take a stab sometime in next few weeks once chatbots launch is done. @Bas - I'm curious, at these insurers, would the adjusters usually see the build output/query the docs from their own ops tool?
