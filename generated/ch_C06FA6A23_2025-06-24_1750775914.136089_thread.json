      "message": ":wave:  ECR Cleanup for Production Images\nLinked is a list of images we *propose to delete from our public ECR repos not pulled in 60d*. For context, we use a replication feature in ECR, which pushes all images published to a root region (us-east-1) to four additional regions which hold customer stacks (us-east-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, and eu-west-2). This round of cleanups is targeting ONLY the replicated regions as a way to de-risk this operation in stages. After this cleanup, if it turns out we deleted something we still require, we can grab the image from the root region (us-east-1) and replace. Please let me know if you have any concerns. The cleanup will be performed on *Monday, Jun 30*.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jB6VYzR__k1E41Ll_ZvD_-GBtmb-5sYSvd5y-H1DCo/edit?usp=sharing",
