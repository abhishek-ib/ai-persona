Iâ€™m concerned that there will be a case that a deleted patch will need to be affect multiple key value pairs, some of which are still required. Suppose you have patch that changes key value pairs A, B, and C. Suppose A and B are required, but C needs to be deleted. You canâ€™t cherry pick the key value pairs you want to preserve when you delete a patch. I believe the solution should either to be cognizant enough to include a patch to delete the offending value in the PR, or, if this case comes up again, write a new patch to delete the value through the control plane ui",
