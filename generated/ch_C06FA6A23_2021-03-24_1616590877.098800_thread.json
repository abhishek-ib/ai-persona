      "message": "Hi Engineering team - @Faisal and I came off a TDD yesterday with National Bank of Canada with some follow up questions to address below:\n\n1. For our capabilities in NLP - what do we use under the hood? Do we support spaCy?\n2. Do we have more generic primitives aside from get/name - Are there any plans to add other generic primitives? If so what?\n3. What's our authentication process when calling an API from outside the platform? Do we use Oauth? Tokens?\n4. How do we calculate confidence - realise we're not there yet but how do we ensure this is something we're thinking about and is part of our roadmap\nAny help to any of the above questions would be greatly appreciated :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks team!",

Definitely something we’re thinking about and actively working on.  We currently have the ability to expose OCR confidence; Blueprint has a concept of confidence in everything it does; and deep learning-based extractions also expose very meaningful confidence estimates.",

There are other primitives built into the platform, such as dates, person names, addresses, tables, and more. We are continuously improving these entities, as well as adding more entities. I can’t comment on the roadmap (it’s pretty use case dependent) but our docs + a tour of our Developer Exchange will shed more light on what we have to offer in this space.\n3. Within the Instabase website, a developer can create access tokens which are used for outside API access.\n4. What Daniel said! We use a mix of approaches to solve use cases (ML, rules, etc…), and so confidence scores mean different things depending on the techniques we are using. But we are actively thinking about this!",
