      "message": "hey team, I just tried to build my first application on the new build experience on aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com (http://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com) and I genuinely got stuck a couple of times in the UI. Posting my personal experience here, hope it helps.\n\n• Started by uploading document, all good\n• Then the next action was unclear, I did not know what to do except add a field (I assume this is what happens when you don't classify)?\n• I wanted to classify the documents, and ended up finding the three dots in the top right corner to add a class, then the class field populated with a value that is not relevant (\"Class Name\"), I would prefer it to be empty with a good tip on how to fill it. Ideally I would like to have classification suggestions, but I only get those if I create a second class?\n• After the first class is created, the UI changes and there is a new button to add classes (I first tried to follow my previous route to add a class, but found a link to delete all classes), personally I don't think the UI should change for the same action.\n• The expand buttons for the fields under classes are hidden under the bookmark with the color in front of the class name. This had me searching for where to click to find how to open up the fields\n• I then reclassified the documents but nothing changed. I found the group by icon to group by class that shows the classification. If there is no grouping, I would suggest that after reclassifying the group by class is selected and/or have a visual element that always shows which class a document belongs to.\n• When I add a field from the main window, I have a different UI then when I edit a field (I can't toggle complex and can't change the field name when adding) (also, when changing a field, sometimes the field name is cleared and errors out and I can't save the field anymore because the save button is gone (img 1)\n• When I added field, it was unclear the comma's would separate my values. I wrote a prompt with 2 comma's (couldn't find where to turn on complex prompt when adding the field) and that then got split into three different fields\n• The UI very much suggests that my fields are saved after I clicked the create button, I lost 9 fields on my first run because I forgot to hit the save fields button\n• I created a field (UBOs), clicked on edit, toggled complex then changed the prompt to: \"_Extract a list of Ultimate Benficiary Owners with their full name, nationality and size of interest as a json_\" and then got the same error where the field went empty and the save button disappeared (img 2). When I click into another document then click back, the field is actually created the way I intended.\n• I then went and created the app, ran 2 documents through it. The first one worked, the second one all fields errored (maybe the field that errored before was not created properly after all?) img 3\nI see some great improvements in the UI, but it feels like this UI is much more optimised for power users and a lot less friendly for general users due to unclear navigation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a front end designer :smile:, this is just my experience trying to build an app for the first time, hope it helps. Please reach out if you have any follow up questions!",
