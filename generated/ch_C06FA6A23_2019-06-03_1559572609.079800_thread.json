      "message": "Anyone have 30 minutes today or tomorrow to help debug a really weird bug with the provenance tracking UI (mostly want to get another set of yes on it)? In order to display the highlight boxes, we calculate offset and scaling given the document pixel coordinate, and then draw it on a scaled canvas. We have two versions of the `getScaling` logic, one which works on some docs and not others, and where one doesn’t work, the other does. It may be related to input type (pdf vs image), scanned versus text pulled directly from the PDF, etc, but this bug has been there for months and it has continued to baffle me lol",
