Recommended to use a page size.\n.\n.\n[2] copy/move\nNFS -- we will have to copy or move the entire folder as there is no paging support\nS3 -- we don't have to worry much here since S3 internally manages copy/move operation\n.\n.\nThere is one way to implement List All files operation: when a user clicks  list all files, Instabase internally breaks it down into several listdir calls and loads the results into the UI incrementally.",

      "message": "My implementation of copy and move in the front end currently also has to use listdir, because it has to determine if there are files/folders with the same names - move makes you rename if there is already, and copy will add a (1) to the file name. The lazy loading wouldn't be as helpful in that case so we'd still have to think of solutions for that, but it would be helpful for displaying the files in the UI",
