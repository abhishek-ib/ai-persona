Figma screens of task-based review in https://www.figma.com/design/UE91esgJlmFXpvAH62vRTh/Case-Management?node-id=1104-206735&t=KCMNeUF4ApEWdMP9-0\n2. State of Human Review deck https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lu-KpsQOZYAg3cIKcz9KNKHQRNDRXG49VueZltvoLQo/edit\nAre there any other docs / resources I should look at? Maybe a recording of a spec review meeting if it was done before I joined?",
