      "message": "Hi Folks, we are going to be sunsetting Blameless for incident management for the forseeable future.  Currently, the main features that we used in Blameless was the Slack integration to automatically create channels.  But, we were unable to fully utilize the power of Blameless through the UI or its other set of integrations such as Zoom / JIRA.\n\n*What do we do interim?*\nWe should continue to use Slack as our primary mode of communication during incidents.  To ensure conformity here are some recommendations:\n• Channel name should be of the form `_incident_<date>_<info>`\n• Channel description should have:\n    ◦ small blurb about what the incident is about\n    ◦ note on who is leading the incident\n    ◦ note on how is leading the external communication for the incident\n    ◦ any additional metadata that you want to be in there such as corresponding zendesk tickets, or customers impacted etc.\n• Channel Topic should denote what the Severity of the incident is and a 1 line description [What Blameless does today] `SEV1 | Prod is down`\n*What will happen to our current incidents?*\nFor out current incidents, the slack channel will continue to remain active.  We'll stop the integration with Blameless which will mean that the data will stop syncing over to the Blameless platform.\n\n*What will happen to the past incidents?*\nAll the past incidents will still exist as archived channels and the data within the channels will still be maintained.\n\nWe understand that the automatic integration of Slack and Blameless did make things simpler.  For the medium term, we'll work on finding a suitable replacement that can cover most of our needs.\n\nIf you have any questions / concerns around this please let us know.\n\ncc @Dave",
