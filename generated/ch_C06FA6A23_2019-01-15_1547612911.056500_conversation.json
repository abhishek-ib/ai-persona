This functionality will expand to other python services and later to Go and Java services.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n(a) Wait for the PR checks to be successful before merging!\n(b) If checks fail, and you can't figure out why, ping me or this channel!\n\nIf you want to figure out how to reproduce errors that you see on the travis job that you can't reproduce locally, please look at the `mypy-in-docker` and `make-docker-in-docker` commands.",
