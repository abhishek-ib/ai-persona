      "message": "any thoughts on having some sort of \"create into solution\" or \"export into build\" feature with converse. I feel like Build is already pretty easy to use but the goto entry point for almost everyone is converse and I end up asking some pretty good questions and results with it for 1 document (lets say a resume).\n\nWould be cool to then just feed these questions with this doc type into a build project so I can easily ask the same questions again and again which is what build does. Idk this is just a half-baked thought and i haven't used build much.",
