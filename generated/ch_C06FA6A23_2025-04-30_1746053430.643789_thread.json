Please partner with me on this journey :upside_down_face:\n\nAttached is a monthly cost breakdown by GCP project:\n• *[$8/month] `instabase-for-external-users`*\n    ◦ This project will be gone by the end of this week — that's a burrito saved :burrito: (though maybe not in SF :smile:)\n• *[$1,890/month] `instabase-dev`* \n    ◦ This must be shut down by the end of next week. That's enough to feed half of Instabase with burritos :burrito::burrito:\n    ◦ If you'd like to _keep_ this project, *please respond to this thread ASAP* — otherwise, it's going away\n• *[$6,652/month] `instabase-main`* \n    ◦ Targeting *mid-May* for shutdown. This means completing the GCP :arrow_right: AWS migration for `platform.instabase.com (http://platform.instabase.com)`\n    ◦ I’ll own this one! Burritos for everyone :burrito::burrito::burrito: — SF or not :smile:\n• *[$8,594/month] `instabase-build`*\n    ◦ Still running a devtools K8s cluster. I'd like to delete it *by the end of next week*. @Cody Boggs — please prioritize this\n    ◦ Additional cleanup will need an assessment, especially around relocating Docker images\n• *[$8,774/month] `instabase-public`*\n    ◦ Requires an assessment. This is where Docker images for on-prem customers are stored — we’ll need a careful purge strategy\n    ◦ I’ll take ownership of this one\n:triangular_flag_on_post: Please flag _any concerns_ immediately. Thank you! :pray:\n\n_and in case you haven't noticed, I do love a burrito! cheers!_",
