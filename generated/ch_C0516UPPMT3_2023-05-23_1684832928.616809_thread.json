It says it's being digitized correctly according to the digitization status endpoint, and it even comes back in the tree we get from the documents endpoint - but it doesn't have an ibdoc_path like the other documents. Thus when we classify it and try to look up the name of the document, we can't find it in the tree and get the javascript error.\n\nI'm going to start catching this error in the frontend so it doesn't break everything, but it seems the underlying problem is something in the indexing.",
