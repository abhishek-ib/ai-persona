      "message": "I think in my experience, oversimplification was as common as overfitting - I have seen instances where the generated prompt would be a simple field name with no description and the immediately captured data from that is the wrong information from the doc. This happened more commonly with dates, since it can be hard to distinguish between the correct dates and wrong ones. \n\nI was wondering if it’d be possible to do something like “this, not that” where you can also select what you don’t want to get from the document? Doing this across multiple samples could be helpful",
