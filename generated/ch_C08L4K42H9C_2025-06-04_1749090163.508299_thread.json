      "message": "(context: https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-4390) BTW a question connected to the one about exposing secret keys.\nWe plan to expose custom variables. I believe while it's not as sensitive as exposing secrets (we can be sure that downstream & API users has some level of access), it's still a good idea to document this. So ideally we can add note in documentation/on UI to establish agreement of what we can and can't send downstream.\n\nWDYT?\nIf it's a good idea, I believe this is the good place for note in documentation:\nhttps://docs.instabase.com/apps/custom-functions#adding-custom-and-secret-keys-in-custom-functions\nand on UI we can do it on project editor view\n\nPosting there, so support discussion will be more focused",
