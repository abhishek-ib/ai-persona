The solution can also a*utomatically add \"_possibly related threads/issues/tickets_\" at the end of your message as additional context* for the reviewing parties.\n    d. Maybe *auto generate a `<interval>` report* o*f the most \"common\" / top-k trending terms/issues/affected product surfaces, with a list of threads as added context*\n*Benefits:*\n• This could help *reduce engineering/support effort and time for both EPD + the reporter*.\n    ◦ _Ex. Just this week, I was the third person (back-to-back, I'm pretty sure) to post in one of our channels about `review metrics` being down, and having the heads-up would have probably saved time (I could have probably scrolled up / searched, too, but_ :oops: :lil_nervous: :bow:_)_\n• *Support feedback programs*, *such as the recently revived monthly \"Field to EPD\" feedback meetings* where \"field reps\" highlight issues/submit tickets on behalf of their teams/depts to EPD.\n• *Potentially,* this could be *a marketable \"issue screener\" integration for other companies* to use in Slack/AI Hub, too?\n*Notes:*\n• The essence of this use-case may already be captured in the roadmap/use-case vision for `Search` <#C06JCLSTLAW|> \n• Sounds potentially resource intensive, but sharing anyways :oprah_yougeta: \nThanks for reading this short novel :pusheen-read-research:",
