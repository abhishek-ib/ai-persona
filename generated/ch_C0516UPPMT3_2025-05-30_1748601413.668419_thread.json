Technically the work to have this run on Sat night is very straightforward - change the schedule for cron / ICC maintenance schedule. However we have encountered instances in past where the platform upgrade can fail, and we need escalations to be handled. I will discuss internally with the stakeholders to see how we can do this from availability on weekends.",
