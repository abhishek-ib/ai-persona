I did more testing on that docker image and it seemed to just be random whether the first run was successful or not albeit subsequent runs did have a lower probability of succeeding than the first.",

Presumably this cap was getting hit (I’m running a few different services with the docker containers instead of locally), bumping that to 8 GB solved the problem.",
