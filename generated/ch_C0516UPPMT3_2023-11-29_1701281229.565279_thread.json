We want to make this the default extraction pipeline but we need to know if you have tested and if you are satisfied with the results.\n\nPlease respond to this thread if you have used and if it was it good or if you found problems :slightly_smiling_face:",

The current extraction method uses the long doc pipeline if the document is big and this leads to different results base on the document size (and long doc replies tend to be more chatty)",
