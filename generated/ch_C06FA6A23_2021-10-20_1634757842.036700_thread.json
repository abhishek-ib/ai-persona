Right now, our model training jobs are read from a database table, so models trained on one env would not show up in the app in other envs. The model itself is of course just a file, so it can be used on other envs.",

If customers see a file which contains data and can be moved it's expected to be portable and self contained. For things like metrics, which I'm assuming you access via a UI or a query of some sort I think expectations are different.",
