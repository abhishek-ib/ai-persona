      "message": "For some context: this can happen with `TableList` since it was built before css subgrid was fully supported on all recent versions of modern browsers. As such is uses flexbox & support `flex` properties for adjusting column sizes. Since each row is a flexbox & each cell can flex, the rows can get out of alignment if there’s overflowing content.\n\n`TableGrid` is newer & uses `subgrid` so this will never be an issue on any newer tables as long as they’re built with this newer table component.",
