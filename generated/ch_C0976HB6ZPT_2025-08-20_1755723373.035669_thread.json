      "message": "After a few days of experimentation, it turns out that it's really easy to display PDFs. A quick background:\n1. Our DocWidget component (used in Build, Human Review, Converse, etc) only supports showing a list of pictures\n2. react-pdf's underlying dependency, pdfjs, makes converting PDFs into image files really easily, even for specific pages\nIn other words, we can convert PDFs into images, and put them into DocWidget and everything works. We can even generate thumbnails by converting the PDFs into images with a super low resolution.\nSo PDFs are basically a solved problem - I can easily expose some functions that convert PDFs to images from the DocWidget library. Provenance as I talked about with Jemin is just a conversion from scaling values to actual width, height, and coordinates.\n\n@Anil Your concerns about other file types still remain though - we just don't have any good way to render them or  to tackle provenance there if it's a file type like EML (which we currently render out, rather than just show the raw text). But also you mentioned the other day that we can do a conversion to PDF in the backend - if we can do that and expose the files for the UI to fetch, it'll be really easy. If we don't convert to PDF, we can do rendering okay with extra code to handle each file type, but provenance would be a big mess.\nSo I wanted to get some clarity on what we can do here\ncc @Serena",
