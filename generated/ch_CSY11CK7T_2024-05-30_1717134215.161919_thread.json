      "message": "@Xindi Xu I have a PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58086)  that updates a protobuf file and has 30k line changes in `compiled-protos.d.ts`. I took a look in vscode and it seems like almost all the changes look like its just reformatting the code (see below). Is my protobuf version out of date? I have 3.20.3 installed, which matches whats in `requirements_py37.txt`. Or maybe is there another package thats involved that I need to update or something so that I don't get all these redundant changes?",
