But this seems to be related to that.\n\nI feel the root cause behind all these is the model change from OpenAI's side.\nLLM is not returning answers in the desired/asked format and hence we're failing to parse the value.\n\nI have another PR to change the OpenAI model to the March versions(i.e. `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`) - based on which we have designed all of our prompts and parsing logic. Moving back to that, should solve most of these issues.\n\n@Lee if you can share the document and the prompt/field name, I can test whether it's working with March version models...",
