Then we verify against phone numbers before just handing credits to any new account.\n\n(I tried this with open ai and that’s what they did)",

And when ChatGPT came out, I decided it'd be good to have a personal login to access it.  However, they wouldn't let me create a personal account since my number had been used for 2 other accounts already.",
