      "message": "Hi there, qq re https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-4085\n\nThe idea behind the proposed fix is to send an URL with parameter passed as runId (camelCase)\nHowever other parts of our app expect it as a parameter formatted in snake_case, e.g.:\nhttps://https--demetr-sand2-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/workspaces/deploy/runs?run_id=5334b769-efa4-49ab-a247-2e750f72c374\n\nmy question is:\nDo we have any agreement on the parameter format? (If we do, we potentially may want to fix our web client as well)\n\nBased on what I see right now most of places has camelCase, e.g. \"My workspace\" view take a filter in camelCase:\nhttps://https--demetr-sand2-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/workspaces/review/documents?workspace=d[â€¦]Id=5334b769-efa4-49ab-a247-2e750f72c374 (https://https--demetr-sand2-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/workspaces/review/documents?workspace=demetr.starshov_instabase.com&runId=5334b769-efa4-49ab-a247-2e750f72c374)\nalso based on what Serena said I assume that all views will be changed anyway (so no UI fix is needed rn), but I wanted to check if we have any agreement re this",
