They also said the design of this box was an improvement, but used up a lot of credits because its now really hard to see which model you are currently using. Its easy to leave it on Advanced for ages and use up a lot of credits. Can we make the model you are currently using more obvious? Even if this is highlighted somewhere in the conversation history?",

The tool-tip for the model selection button shows the current model\nAnd I completely agree the conv history can get lengthy and  it's not visible any more. And tool tip is not very obvious. We will address this.\ncc: @Varun Jain @tj.serkes @Aayush",
