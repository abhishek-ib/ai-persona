      "message": "I got similar issue as this thread `make build-protos` doesn't update the `pb2.py` . Anyone know how to fix? Should I downgrade python to 3.7, which breaks toml?\n\nWhat I did was I updated a new request attribute in `protos/model_service/model_service.proto` and ran  `poetry run make build-protos` before `git add` under `~/instabase/data-services/model-services/model-service` . Both `pb2.pyi` and`pb2.py` seems not changed. I can manually update `pb2.pyi` but seems I need to generate `pb2.py` though our make tool.",
