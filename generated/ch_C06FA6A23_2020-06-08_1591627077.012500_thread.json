Or are golden tests unique to our Instabase lingo?  @Aaron Vontell can you help?\nFor example, @laura and I are working to improve the Test Runner app (https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/reference/apps/test-runner/) doc:\n> If you choose one of the validation types that require a “golden” (aka reference) comparison file, you will need to create this reference file. See the _Reference_ section for more details.\n> One suggestion for creating “golden” .ibocr files for V1 Test Runner: Run an existing Flow, and use that as a template that you can then manually inspect and modify to what you expect to get.",
