That concept doesn’t exist yet in Infra land — so Heymian anticipates that work to be 2 - 3 months away.\n\nHence — to move away from is_site_admin (in places like Custom Classifier) — we will use app:refiner can_write permission bit with our ACL system. Here is an example of how we use that today:\n\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/distributed-tasks/celery/app-tasks/src/py/instabase/tasks/apps/train_refiner_util.py#L327\n\nPlease let us know if you have any thoughts on the decision",
