In the following weeks you will notice changes to how we specify our configurations as they will be mostly templated out to adhere to Helm conventions and best practices.\nStarting shortly, this week you will notice a change in directory structure for all base configs, but the contents of these will be mostly the same. The chart can be found @ `deployment-configs/chart`.\nAs this project is in process, we are adding a new CODEOWNERS group so we can review any changes to the chart, please post in <#C058UFAGWTF|> if you need us to review some changes.\nPlease reach out to the <#C058UFAGWTF|> channel if you have any questions or need help adding configurations to the new structure.",
