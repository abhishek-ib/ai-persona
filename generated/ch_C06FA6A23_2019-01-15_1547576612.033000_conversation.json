Right now, we have a large number (<100) of different Legal Templates that we use, and as policy changes we have to manually update them all. Could we build a workflow on Instabase that essentially defined a set of generic templates, and then pulls in relevant policy attributes from different sources as and when we need it to ensure they remain relevant?\"",
