These apply a standard set of resource configuration for each size bucket, but we'll need to rework these a bit based on learnings from this weekend.\n\nThe current sandbox provisioning (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dG3TA07-_64pKYLtvWStt-8aLLMwCeeTzmXDjlpw4hs/edit#gid=1542399463) represents the 'small' size well. Prod (https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/workload/overview?project=instabase-main&pageState=(%22savedViews%22:(%22i%22:%2271c1e8cc9080466992bbf6987874a286%22,%22c%22:%5B%22gke%2Fus-central1-c%2Finstabase-main-prod-002%22%5D,%22n%22:%5B%22instabase-prod%22%5D))) is currently running close to a 'medium' size.",
