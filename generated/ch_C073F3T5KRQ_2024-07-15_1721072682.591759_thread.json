Don’t worry fellow backend engineers, it shouldn’t block your PRs — you can still merge if it fails. But you will see a new Github action in your PR (see screenshot).\n\nNote these test results are not 100% accurate since we’ve yet to add Crafting interception support for our asynchronous + Golang services (i.e. only updates to `api-server`, `apps-server` and `webapp` are compiled and tested against). We have plans to address this. We’ve yet to figure out timeline but we will put updates in this doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XcFodp18QQvkN90-F4DhkaJtRiXhR6vn35fr75EN24/edit#heading=h.rupl0ov5ueeg).\n\nIf you have any issues or questions, please let me know or post them in this thread.",
