It’s no different than any of the other pages in the AI Hub docs, so I’m trying to figure out why it was flagged. I’m wondering if Semrush crawled the whole AI Hub docs site, or just randomly hit this page?",

      "message": "Hey @Chris Cowell, the automated site audit is currently limited to a scan of about 100 pages, so it only picks up only a fraction. I can schedule a deep audit, which will take a while. Currently up to 65% of our pages have potential issues with duplications. In part this is due to the URL co-hosting with the original enterprise product. This is being split over the next few months, at which point the marketing site moves to a hosted service (eg WP Engine). I would like to do a full site audit at that time.\n\nBut in short - when we have duplicates such as these we should first investigate if they are required. Typically a duplicate index site is not required. If it is required, then best practice is to make the desired site (likely the non-index one) canonical to avoid showing up as a duplicate.",
