      "message": "Hey all, in reference to this thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1753986585530409), I have a question: Currently, when you run `cs up <service>` it tries to (a) build the service and (b) run the service. This ensures that changes to code are reflected in the docker container that's running the service.\n\nHowever, it also causes a lot of rebuilds when things go wrong. Wondering if we should require manually running `make build-docker && cs restart <svc>`  for services that you know have changed? Not ideal, but it would prevent the rebuilds from going haywire.\n\nI also asked Crafting to limit the number of retries when rebuilding/rerunning a service, so it doesn't churn indefinitely.",
