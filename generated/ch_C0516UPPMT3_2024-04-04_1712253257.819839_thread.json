      "message": "Hi there, I'm building an Ask Trust Chatbot and I had a couple questions:\n• is there a way to append prompts behind the scenes? for example, if someone asks \"When was the BCP last tested\" can we tack on \"respond with a customer-facing response\" to the question? that way the response is targeted to a customer versus the requestor. \n• is there a way to add a \"cover page\" to the app so the first thing the user sees is a bit more welcoming? yes, I could upload the cover page as a source file...\n• can i create my own examples and best practices?\n• can i hide or rearrange the source files?",

But honestly, we need to implement custom instructions (JIRA) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1285) to really support this type of prompting.\n• We are adding this based on the chatbot name and description - [DR-3518] Better first-run orientation for chatbots - display name, description in chat log - Jira (atlassian.net) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/DR-3518)\n• You have full control over the sample queries shown. If you have tried a few queries in the origin converse project, you can bring them over to the chatbot as sample queries while creating the chatbot (or clicking edit chatbot details and updating it). See screenshot #2. For now, you can't edit best practices :slightly_smiling_face: \n• We are planning to introduce a Docless view (JIRA) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1283) to hide the files while a user is asking questions to a chatbot.",
