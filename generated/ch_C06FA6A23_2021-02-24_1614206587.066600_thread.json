You don’t need it anymore! I am happy to answer questions if you run into any problems though (as always :blush:). I will also be monitoring <#CCY413CSU|> to make sure I didn’t break jenkins.",

      "message": "Specifically, I will be merging this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/18114#pullrequestreview-597972539) in at 5pm PST unless people have complaints about it, which will bring the number of image-tasks replicas down to 0 in dogfood (and everywhere it is deployed in the future). It will also remove image-tasks from provisioner.\n\nAs soon as different environments have had their number of replicas brought to 0, the corresponding groovy files can have their image-tasks stages deleted as part of this task (dogfood) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/REF-342?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWIzNDRkZDdlNTY3NGIwNjkyMThhMmZiNzlkNDJmMTEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), and this task (prod) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/REF-343?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMjVmNGZmYzc1ZmQwNDNhZmFlNDE0ODdlZTNhODA1N2EiLCJwIjoiaiJ9). I will also be removing the `distributed-tasks/celery/image-tasks` directory over the next few days.\n\nMajor thanks to @kunal for helping put this together, and if you have any feedback before I merge these final steps, let me know!",
