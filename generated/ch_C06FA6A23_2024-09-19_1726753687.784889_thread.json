Treats the new Artifact Repository as a pull-through cache from the old GCR backend if there are image pulls attempted during the migration\n3. Runs IAM Policy Analyzer to set permissions on the new repo(s) as appropriate\n4. Upon image copy completion, automatically cuts over the `gcr.io/ (http://gcr.io/)<project>` URL to Artifact Repository from GCR\nIf only everything could be this easy. :upside_down_face:",
