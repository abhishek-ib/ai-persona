      "message": "Hey @Charles , typically all the customers block any type of http traffic to leave their infrastructure.  To enable proxies, we need to set up a few environment variables on our app-tasks.  However, these get progressively difficult with different types of proxies.  For example, setting up for zscaler involves us setting up certificate on the pods.  Ntlm involves us setting up some password configuration and sidecars and so on.",
