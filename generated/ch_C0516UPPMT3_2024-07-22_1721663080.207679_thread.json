Interesting feedback from a BMG configuration user, building a solution to extract 40+ fields from Recording License Agreements (40+ page contracts), as he tests between Text Extraction and Document Reasoning.\n> Text Extraction sometimes fails and doesn't extract anything. But Document Reasoning works well.\n> Can we have a way in a single field - if the default chosen field type returns no option - there is a backup field type (e.g. Document Reasoning as a back up to Text Extraction)?\nMore details :point_down:",
