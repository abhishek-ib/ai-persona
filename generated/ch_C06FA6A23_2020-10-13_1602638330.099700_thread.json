      "message": "Hi People, we’ll be shipping the October release to BofA early tomorrow morning.  There are a few changes that might require us to hand hold them through them so would love to get a small excerpt on what setting I should enable, and what are the necessary pre-requisites that we need to follow to get the environment up and running:\n• Flow Tasks in Database: We need to enable the environment flag and create a database @abhilash \n• HITL: @Eric Han @Jonathan Shih \n• Refiner with Jobs Table: @Erick is this going to go through in the release? \n• Boto3 upgrade: @achao \n• … Anything else that I might be missing? \nWe will ask for a couple hours on Thursday to help and verify the installation.  We’ll let you know when the meeting is so that you can keep some cycles free to answer questions.",

First they should deploy the configmap here https://github.com/instabase/deployments/blob/master/customers/baml/poc/configmaps/config via `oc create configmap aws-config --from-file=configmaps/config` ,  Then deploy file-tservice with `enable_s3_boto_config` set to be `true` . Happy to field questions thursday too!",
