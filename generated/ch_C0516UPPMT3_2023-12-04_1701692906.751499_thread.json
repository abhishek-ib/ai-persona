      "message": "@joshbronko - We have optimised the UX in multi file query UX for composite answer type queries (vs a ranked list of results) over a small # of files (think <20 files). We didn’t provide a design affordance for selecting ‘all files’ as we expect that to lead to many search / retrieval queries over a large corpus of files.\n\nPrimary reason is that with many search / retrieval queries, users expect a ranked list of results e.g. ‘tell me all the insurance customers which are affected by X policy change’. Current UX friction in adding a lot of files would discourage such queries, which is our intention. We would support these type of queries as we extend the multi-file queries into Search / Retrieval use case over time.\n\nFYI, we have seen the accuracy of response decreasing with the # of files in scope, as expected. We will revise the limit on the # of files in a Conversation in order to account for this. I’ll share a note with the accuracy benchmarks for multi-file queries later this week.\n\nThanks again for the feedback! Keep it coming to help us improve.\n\n@tj.serkes @Hari @Sławek Biel",
