It is available on the sandbox (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/) and just visit the site on your phone to view it. I didn’t have time to get a physical Android phone to test this on so I’m interested in some feedback regarding it’s use on Android (and iOS as well). We are targeting the release for 23.41 and just polishing it up.",
