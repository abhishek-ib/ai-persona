Folks can :100:  always go to <#CGMBQ0R8E|> to ask any question at all, including \"is this a bug?/where do I do a thing?/how do I look through Jira to find out if this has been reported before?/etc..\". Support shouldn't be a gatekeeper for reporting a bug, but a place to help _you_ do it if you need a hand.\n2. What @paul mentioned there, product feedback, IMO should be the place where \"not sure where this goes but it's like a bug or something wonky for sure\" should go. Not sure if there is a process or group that is monitoring it, though.",
