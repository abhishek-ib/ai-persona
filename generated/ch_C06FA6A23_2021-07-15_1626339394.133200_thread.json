      "message": "Hi @Serena, @Kerry, thanks for taking the time to look at the Scheduler app. Let me provides some context on my requirements:\n• The idea to specify runtime parameters is to extend the way we run flow binaries to scheduling use cases; so my answer is yes, run configs and any other options would be nice to have on the scheduler app (I am presuming that it is using the flow API under the hood so anything that the flow API can handle should be set in the Scheduler App).\n• Regarding time granularity, as the IB platform evolves and is used by many customers, I foresee the need for scheduling to be more prevalent. Now if you have many scheduled jobs to create and execute, you’d want the ability to stagger their execution in time rather than starting on the hour for hourly schedule for instance to prevent contention.\n• Now on the _*very-nice-to-have*_ features, if the scheduling app gets eventually owned and developed further, here are few features worth considering (this is based on experience from another data migration platform I used to support):\n    ◦ Having a ‘By Minute’ option in addition to a max number of execution will be very useful for testing use cases (e.g. I want to test a flow binary  every 15 minutes for 10 execution max )\n    ◦ Having _*date from*_ and *date to* options is also useful to ensure the scheduled jobs start and expire in a control manner (e.g. to prevent executing  a  scheduled job running a specific version of a solution/flow binary for instance beyond a date limit).\n    ◦ The ability to schedule a Notebook would be excellent and would add a reporting and performance monitoring feature to the IB platform in my view; I am an avid (biased) user of Jupyter Notebooks, and I think they are great for tasks like:\n        ▪︎ Automation of OS file movement and cleanup tasks\n        ▪︎ Performance Validation and Monitoring reporting tasks (i.e. confusion matrix and performance report for classification and refiner validation)\n    ◦  Scheduling would mainly be used by SysAdmins and Operational administrators, and as such, they should be able to schedule a Notebook or even a python API client script easily rather than having to wrap up any logic into a flow binary for execution beforehand.\nThese are the potential features that the Scheduler App could be extended with in the very far future. For the short term, runtime config and flow execution options and default start time setup would be nice to set via the app.\n\nI hope this helps.",
