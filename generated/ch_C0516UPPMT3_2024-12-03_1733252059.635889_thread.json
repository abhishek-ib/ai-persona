      "message": "I’m terrible at navigating Figma so I can’t find the page where @margaret.tomaszczuk, Siya (OOO or I’d ask her for the Figma link), and I discussed this, but as I recall when reviewing this initially we did go with different phrasing than consent (granting access)--perhaps similarly to Melissa, I don’t think consenting is _really_ what a user would understand this as. As I understand, for an individual member to search a connected data source we need to determine their level of access to the indexed files by triggering an identity passthrough flow where they log in to the data source (to Google Drive for example). If they haven’t yet completed that identity passthrough step (a one-time action) they’ll see a prompt to do so, coupled with a brief explanation of why. Until then, even if a data source is connected for Search, they can’t actually search it, though they still see it listed as a connected data source.\n\nAll that said, I believe this identity passthrough for Search feature has already been flagged as needing to be rolled back to internal opt-in pending additional design and product input and review. And tbh my own understanding has also shifted (improved) since that first review, so I may revise my suggestions on the phrase “Grant access” during this re-review.\n\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1732631116476459?thread_ts=1732630699.036119&cid=C05BJCNKZAM",
