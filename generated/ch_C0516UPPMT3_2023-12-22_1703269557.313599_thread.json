      "message": "I just noticed some unexpected behavior using the split document function for the first time. After re-classifying documents, one PDF was split into multiple documents. When I click between documents, the viewer doesn't reset back at the beginning of each document. Rather, it takes me to the same position in the new document. If I was on page 2 on document 1, then click on document 2, I'm taken to page 2 of document 2. See the video. I would expect that I'm always taken back to the beginning of the document, or back to where I left off from THAT document. I wouldn't expect it to be relative to the position I was in in another document.",
