      "message": "Hi team, we had a final feedback session with Thirdfort and here's the summary:\n1. Thirdfort has a product that runs source of fund verification, proof of address, and other verifications for financial institutions. They are looking to automate these workflows using AI Hub for customers that don't want to use open banking to submit their data\n2. Within 2 weeks, Thirdfort was able to create a solution in Build that extracts transaction table, currency, ending balance, and account number from bank statement. They were satisfied with the accuracy of the solution and would like to move forward with AI Hub\n3. We were compared against Homeppl (https://www.homeppl.com/products/information/). Compared against them, we were much better at extracting information from scanned docs and photos, and they found our platform to be very easy to use (\"too easy to use\" at some points :sweat_smile:)\n4. The biggest piece of feedback they had for improving our offering was around transaction table extraction. Knowing our expertise in solving for this challenge, they would have liked to see a template - not just a generic one for bank statements, but also one that contains how to extract transaction tables well accounting for most of the variability that exists across different banks' statements.\n    a. On this note, I'm gonna have one more session with them to enable them on some of the best practices around working with bank statements. *If anyone has an example of a good transaction table field with robust cleaning functions that account for variability, please let me know.*",

You can definitely take a look at the existing Bank Statement marketplace app (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/75cbf90b-9edd-4253-a33d-81b4f2f0e88c) where the accuracy reported for the `Transaction Table` is ~75%. So far there is no UDF added for the clean up of data but if there is a need, please share the specifics and we can take a look.",
