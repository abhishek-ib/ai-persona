      "message": "Hey all.. If you have received the AIHub preview access, continue reading..\n\nWe just rolled out a new model package version on the https://aihub.preview.instabase.com/. This is expected to give better responses to queries, But there are going to be some limitations until we fully implement the long document pipeline. Pls note the following while you test:\n1. Responses tend to be slower than what you have seen until now but the responses will be more accurate\n2. We have limited the page intake to 8K token(~8 pages on an average document, if your document is dense then the page size would be even smaller)\n    a. What does this mean? Any queries related to excluded pages(beyond the 8K token limit) will not be answered\n3. When you have multiple documents in a folder and you are using the \"All Document Mode\", only 3 docs are considered and the same limitation of 8K applies to these 3 docs individually. Recommendation is to keep your document count <= 3 in a single project.\nBut within the scope of these limitations you can expect the model to perform very well. :slightly_smiling_face:\nWe are working on removing these limitations very soon. Watch this space for more updates in the coming days.",
