Help us build our golden datasets!\n\nFor starters, it would be great if you could help us annotate 10 documents for a particular document type:\n\nWhat I’m asking:\n   1. Put your name next to “Status” for one of the document types\n   2. Read the instructions\n   3. Complete 10 documents and let us know when you are done!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYbPsxeyvCg_oItc41XFQzkYaEp8iHoesBEDlVJJEeQ/edit#\n\nIt takes a little bit of time to understand the document format; but once you do; it might take 1 - 2 hours to annotate these 10 documents\n\nPlease let me know if you can help (we need it); we are looking to compare against these golden answers over the weekend, then Monday, and we will iterate on them until Wednesday",
