      "message": ":moneybag:*Pricing Update*:moneybag: \n\nHi Everyone - Wanted to share an announcement that we'll be modifying AI Hub pricing. The pricing policy (https://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/pricing-policy/index.html) has been updated on the website with the changes and an email notification will be going out to AI Hub users today. The pricing will be effective starting Feb 5th for all AI Hub community users and will be effective the first billing cycle to begin on or after feb 5th for all AI Hub commercial users.\n\nThe key changes are:\n• *Adjusted document page tiers and increased rates for the default model across converse and build.* The document page tiers are more reflective of our customers' volume and increased default rates help us preserve more margin and give us room to discount further for volume commitments\n• *Decreased the rates of advanced model + mulit-step model* to make it more accessible to users and in preparation for using gpt-4-turbo, which should reduce our own cost of providing the service\n• *Eliminated the batch run discount.* All build apps will be charged at the build rates. Commercial customers will now be able to get discounts on high-volume usage by making volume commitments\nThe pricing changes were made taking into account data points from our prospective commercial customers as well as our costs for providing the service. Thanks for everyone's help that worked on this. Please thread with any questions! cc: @Varun Jain @Bastiane @Tom @mfichman @alex",
