      "message": "*AI Hub Pro - Weekly Update*\ntl;dr - Encouraging signs in terms of retention and consumption by active registered users. We need to continue improving the product to deliver more value for our users and unlock paid conversion.\n\n*Metrics (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15sckWTapLbmcouCGZUImpigtXrLGl4ucYe1pmXjpmpA/edit#gid=963651688)*\n(screenshot attached)\n\n*Key Insights*\n• We acquired ~260 new registered users last week. There was 55% increase in weekly active users from 745 to 1158.\n    ◦ Higher user acquisition from SEO campaign and effect of PR blitz in India the preceding week drove the higher user activity.\n• Retention of the registered users continued to improve from 22.3% to 26% last week.\n    ◦ We also need to increase the absolute # of registered users coming as we increase the total registered user base week on week.\n    ◦ We will extend this analysis by tracking the user cohorts by time of acquisition. This is the standard way to measure the overall product engagement.\n• Weekly Converse app activity (# of queries) more than doubled to 3.5K queries last week. Build app has seen limited activity so far among the Pro users as expected.\n• The total consumption has increased by 45% to 23.7K units from 16.4K units last week. So far, there have been 873 external users with non zero consumption. Distribution of the user consumption is as follows:\n    ◦ 90th percentile : 297 units\n    ◦ 75th percentile: 98 units\n    ◦ 50th percentile : 31 units\n    ◦ Average consumption : 111 units\n• 20 users consumed ~1000 free trial units fully. We are reaching out to the top 100 users by consumption to understand how to unlock paid conversion.\n*Customer Feedback*\n• There is high interest among potential partners (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qZQYe_iatRwLLvd3V_OjogcSKosrtLPo5cmHVA_PVcQ/edit#gid=0) to embed AI Hub capabilities in their workflows. We are working closely with field teams to prioritize among these prospects, and address the gaps in the product to make these partnerships successful.\n• We are also actively working with a few prospects (e.g. Dalbar (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJaAIRMUNtPYc9MGkq1Pg_lwfaXd_6gt2_Q983cYGk4/edit#bookmark=id.okzm5lesps70)) who are interested in publishing their apps on AI Hub to help us seed a 3rd party community in Q3.",
