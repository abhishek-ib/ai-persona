This is a dependency if we want to build the jenkins image. I am trying to figure out if that is even needed anymore (to circumvent a build error caused by that dependency)? IIUC, any dependency that the jenkins image has, should be present at atleast one more place such as, another service or library. But I was unable to find more than one occurrence of that.",
