But we do still want to introduce behavior change for \"automated upgrades\"\n\n• Naming convention: we will still go with 2.x naming\n• We won’t support additional releases to the 1.x path after 2.0 - \n• We will maintain current app/runtime behavior in accuracy runs - i.e. we will deprecate the toggle in app runs to choose processing mode\n• Introduce discussed behavior change for apps on “automated upgrades”. All apps will basically be treated as \"when expired\", meaning they'll be auto-upgraded to agent mode on current support timeframe:\n    ◦ 1 mo - commercial\n    ◦ 6 mos - enterprise\n• Given shortened upgrade timelines, include extra time for regression testing in project plan\n• Incorporate this identified improvement (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-4586?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiOWJhNGIwZDFjZmM2NGMzZjljMmFmNjczMTRjMTA1YTkiLCJwIjoiamlyYS1zbGFjay1pbnQifQ) to AI Runtime behavior to honor support window starting _when the new version is released_\n• Maintain the “update runtime in place” functionality - reduces overhead for deployments/eventually workflows\ncc: @Anil @lydia @Serena @melissa.amos",

      "message": "> there is a potential bug w/ how the maintain app behavior GA release version is impacting expiration dates currently, which is a separate ticket, but will be included in this work\ncan you explain the bug more? We did add logic that the expiration window shouldn't start until the GA release version, so that AI runtimes that were released before we GA'ed maintain app behavior wouldn't immediately be expired. This is because we shipped AI runtime app freezing a few releases before we GA'ed the UI flow. So you can imagine if we didn't have this logic, older runtimes might already show as expired the moment the AI runtime UI flow appeared.",
