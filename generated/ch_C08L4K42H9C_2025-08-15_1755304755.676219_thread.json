I need help trying to send the following metadata for audit logging:\n\napps.py - apps create, update, delete logging\n• app_id\n• ~workspace_id~\n• ~workspace_name~\nprojects.py - apps run logging\n• ~workspace_id~\n• ~app_name~\n• ~app_version~\napp_deployments.py - app deployments update logging\n• app_name\n• workspace_id\n• workspace_name\n• Note: it's inconsistent as sometimes these fields are populated and sometimes they aren't depending on what on the app deployment is being updated",
