      "message": "Hello <!channel> (apologies for this use but its kind of necessary). I am working on fixing all of our sandboxes running on master from being down. The current update is this - due to an env var misconfiguration, services couldnt talk to each other, so despite being up, the platforms were down. We have reverted the changes causing the root issue. Currently, all of these sandboxes are attempting to update, but are timing out at the revive stage. The reason for this is that the revive pipeline waits for the platform to be up by sending a get request to its main URL and waiting until there is a non-error http code. However, since the platform is down, this never happens, so we do not proceed with the update to the deployment. I have done a work around using a custom branch and provisioner script to skip this stage once for aihub-sandbox and also for crafting-aihub. Please let me know if there are any other affected sandboxes",
