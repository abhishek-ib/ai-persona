I started a thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05KE5WE2TE/p1730406471724729) with Hannah on this.\nThe issue:\nInternal accounts ( `@instabase.com` emails) automatically get access to all enterprise preview features, even if the user is in a commercial org. This makes development & testing difficult because internal accounts will never see the upsell feature until it's GAed.\n\nSolutions:\n• Immediate term: use external accounts for developing/testing. On UAT, use the \"External Commercial User\" account from 1pass. We can easily update a user's email to make the account \"external\" via the admin app without breaking anything.\n• Long term, I'll work on adding a flag to indicate if an internal account should/should not have access to all enterprise preview features when they are in a commercial org. One open Q, what's the default value for this flag? \n    ◦ Default on: internal accounts will have access to all enterprise preview features (current behavior)\n    ◦ Default off: internal accounts will not have access to enterprise preview features when using a commercial org.",
