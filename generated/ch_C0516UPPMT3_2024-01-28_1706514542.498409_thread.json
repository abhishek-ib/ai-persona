      "message": "A friend at business school (HBS) wanted to use Converse to summarise a case. I told him to try AI Hub and his first impressions were pretty bad since he was using the default model. I then recommended that he try multistep/advanced because summarisation is a challenging task for long docs. The reaction was very different - he was super impressed and said he'll share it with friends too! An immediate NPS detractor to NPS promoter conversion!\n\nCould we consider something lightweight to recommend multistep/advanced automatically? Or consider switching the default altogether to multistep given our focus on more sophisticated users/usecases moving forward.",
