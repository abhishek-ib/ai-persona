You should have already gotten a happy hour invite from Grace for 9/22, and on 9/21 the entire eng team is invited to a *day-long* *field trip to Half Moon Bay*! School's out, wooooo. You can RSVP here (https://forms.gle/Ldpd7kxp8ANV6Rws6). I've also put the details of the schedule in the description. Look for the calendar hold for the day coming soon!",
