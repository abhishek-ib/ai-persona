      "message": "Here's a quick kudos as AI Hub proved to be very useful for me in one of my hobbies this past weekend.  And it could present a novel marketing approach if we ever decided we wanted to target consumers from the bottom-up (as opposed to our current top-down enterprise/SMB focus).\n\nI was playing Rogue Trader, a tabletop roleplaying game kinda like D&D, with a bunch of friends last Saturday and decided to upload the rulebook into AI Hub.  We were constantly encountering questions about how to handle certain situations in the game and the book is very hard to look through and find clear answers quickly.  Then someone said \"I'd bet AI would be good at this\", so I created an AI Hub account with my personal email address, uploaded the PDF, and got an answer to a question faster than anyone could look up the answer manually.\n\nMy friends were very impressed and the game master was appreciative of our provenance that allowed quick confirmation that the answer was correct.  Lots of TTRPGs have situations like this constantly, and so TTRPG players could prove to be a lucrative use-case to advertise to if we ever wanted to focus on consumers.",
