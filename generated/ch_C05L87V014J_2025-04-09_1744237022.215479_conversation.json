It stuck at \"CustomizeHome\" step\nSample sandboxes: https://instabase.sandboxes.site/sandboxes/pr-69654-cypress?cw=dev\nProbably has something to do with nginx/webpack too?\nI tried deleting the sandboxes and re-run Cypress CI but that didn't help. Going to try again.\nDoes anyone know what happens and how to resolve it?",
