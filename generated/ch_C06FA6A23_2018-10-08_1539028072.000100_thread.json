      "message": "Hey all - want to ask if any of you know how this could be done in Instabase:\nIs there a way to *break away* in the middle of a flow to manually edit the intermediate data, then start the flow again to finish the rest of the steps/calculation?\n\n_Use case_: In SwissRe's premium validation, they want to perform a lookup between the input data and an existing csv file. If some value in the input data is not in that csv table, they want to let the underwriter manually add an entry to the csv table. After that, a bunch of calculation will be done on using the input data + that csv table and some other static files.\n\nWithout that manual entry step, the whole validation can be implemented as a flow. With this manual step I'm not sure how to do it. I can hardcode this lookup-and-edit feature into the onboarding app, but I feel like it should be handled somewhere else (onboarding app is  mostly about data extraction and schema mapping)",

Or is there a way to automatically trigger the second flow?\n\nOne idea: if we can support letting a flow be triggered based on some data change in a file, we can sort of enable the second flow to run automatically after the user edits the intermediate data",

Kerry — I don’t have anything to add to the ideas you and Jess already have, but if you __do__ find something that works well here, this will be an amazing feature in general to have (Flow->Human->Flow as a general sequence). We don’t really have any building blocks right now that represent “human in the loop”.",
