      "message": "@Hamish the claim on temperamental estimates is expected from a technical perspective. We use a minimum logprobs aggregation for the response, which even with temperature fixed to 0 still generates widely varying probability estimates…\nWe can reduce this variance in follow up work by testing self-consistency approaches and averaging over multiple soft votes.\nAs I chatted with @Kaustubh (KD) , our confidence estimation needs a major revisit, preferably start of Q3.",

Just for transparency sharing the “quality” graph for the current production estimator.\nThe aspect of confidence variability (your observation from eg rerunning a field) is not captured here, which is something we will need to add to the benchmarking methodology [thinking out loud: bootstrap sample and accumulate stats on non-determinism per data point].",
