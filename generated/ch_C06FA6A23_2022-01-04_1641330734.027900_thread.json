Thanks @Kai for all the hard work to get this pushed out!\n\nPersistent caching is currently being used for *ocr-msft* and *celery backend*. Everything else is using non-persistent caching. If there are any other use cases that need persistent caching, please reach out to us! Also please let us know if you notice any issues!",
