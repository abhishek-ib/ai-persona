So my first step would be to check the user’s permission and see if they are a site admin. That may explain the difference in number.\n\nThe second thing is flow dashboard only supports flow V2 and V3. Flow V1 jobs are not there. V1 flows are non-compiled flows - so for example, if you run a ibflow from the UI and de-select “compile and run as a binary”.\n\nMany common features like pre and post-flow UDF, logging, using Marketplace packages, are not supported in Flow V1. So it is rarely used now, but it might still be worth checking to see if JPMC ran some flows in this legacy mode.\n\nOtherwise, flow dashboard should be the source of truth for flow jobs (runs).",
