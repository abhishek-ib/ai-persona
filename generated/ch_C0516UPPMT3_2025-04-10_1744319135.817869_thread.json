      "message": "Hi, I would not ask if 'Search' had any idea: Is there anyway I can rerun the extraction for the fields that are dependent on another field that changed in human review? I remember this question had been asked before but I can't find where? If not, will this be available in future? Or any suggestion to work-around this? In a simple example (SS), the Intake Sheet = Header Mapping, so it is empty because the app had empty results for Header Mapping --> When I filled the field Header Mapping, I want the Intake Sheet to get the updated content",

I think we will be able to focus more on our strategy for these scenarios once Case Management V1 is out, and we also generally improve the review experience for tables (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3566). Unfortunately within review the only workarounds are manual, we only re-run extraction if a document is reclassified.\n\n@suleiman.odat what customer is this for?",
