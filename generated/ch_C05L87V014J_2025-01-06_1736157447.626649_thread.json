Couple points/questions from myself:\n• @lydia crafting \"sandbox\" != instabase \"sandbox\" -- a crafting sandbox is a virtual machine, an instabase sandbox is an EKS cluster with instabase deployed to it\n• This is most likely related to crafting's automatic purging of \"stale\" sandboxes, which is currently set to two weeks\n• We most likely are seeing this surfaced now due to the holiday break -- I've bumped the retention to 1 month for now\n• Is there a specific retention period that people would prefer we set going forward?",

My crafting sandbox connected to my personal fork of instabase was deleted when we moved away from forks. I assumed that was related, but maybe it was just hitting the 2-week retention period.",

For my use case 2 weeks is pretty less since I use one sandbox for frontend and other for backend where it might be a month long gap between their use.",
