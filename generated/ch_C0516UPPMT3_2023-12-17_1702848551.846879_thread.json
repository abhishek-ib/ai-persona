It seems that prompt engineering only takes it so far (though it does help some). Attaching examples in the chat.\n\nWill Clean Custom Functions be released Monday along with Prompts?",

      "message": "Update: changing the clean prompt to, \"reformat the \"Total Carb\" key to \"Total Carbohydrate\". return all the rest of the keys as are\", fixed this problem. Think this is just something to be conscious of for anyone customer facing - Functions may be the more consistent option over Prompts sometimes.\n\nThe potential challenge I can see for customers is the time it takes to find prompts that work consistently. I imagine that a lot of new AI Hub users may not realize it can take a couple hours of iterating and testing to find things that work across all document formats. This has always been a challenge for initial Extraction/Reasoning prompting, but now we're adding additional space for them to get lost.\n\nI wonder if a little reminder pop up saying \"try tweaking your prompts with XYZ\" would help push folks in the right direction - especially on Commercial trials. Maybe there's an indicator that could flag this message to come up (like someone testing a field prompt in the Build interface 3 times in a row without navigating to a different field or class)?\n\ncc: @hannah @Bastiane @Lee @Tom",
