      "message": "Code to take clusters and build a classifier wouldn't be too tough (making a UI would take a little bit of time though). The problem with that is that a human still needs to go through and decide what to do with each cluster, so it's almost a \"pointless\" task anyways. But I say that because rather what we should be doing is building an interface specifically for building up classifiers usefully, and maybe that relies on clusters.",

Cluster would be my easy way to just be like I know the documents look like this so click click click and the remaining i can figure out variants",

Maybe we can improve it to something along the following lines: 1) Select folder of docs you want to classify, 2) recommends different classes using the cluster app, 3) user selects and gives names to the clusters they wants to use, 4) we automatically create the base flows and folder structures for those files",
