I just ran a demo and in the hour between my dry run and the demo the UI changed which meant I had to explore on the fly. Do customers get notified of changes so they don't get confused or lost with product updates?\n\nI also made a bunch of enablement videos this morning which are probably out of date now :melting_face:",

We do have 2-4 weeks of flags before we add a feature to GA but if customers never opt in to new features then it would feel like they are thrusted with new features. I do think most features are small enough that we don't need to make an announcement for them though.",
