As @Kerry has said many times, let's not let on-prem hold us back from exploring the best solutions for our Saas offerings. We don't have to offer the same thing for on-prem, we just need to communicate the gap or an alternative solution. In this case, since the ease of debugging is mainly for our eng team, it wouldn't really apply for on-prem anyways (since we don't have access to debugging tools on-prem).",
