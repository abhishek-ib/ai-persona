Here are our updates for the daily standup:\n*Aaron:*\n- Created PR and made improvements for Reporting app - used for displaying results on Citi POC\n- Worked on new rule for P&L use case, working on refinements - should be \"done\" with P&L this week\n- Starting to shift focus to market commentary for the rest of this week and next week\n*Loc:*\n- Implementing blur preprocessing in image preprocessing before Refiner for Goldman Sachs POC\n- Collected PDF docs and created blur data set for `is_blur` evaluation\nSo sorry we couldn't make it to the Zoom call! We will update the Asana board as well @Matt",
