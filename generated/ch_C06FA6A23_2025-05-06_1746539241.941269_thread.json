I'll put together a more organized doc to propose such :slightly_smiling_face:",

This is because once anything changes \"in the past\" in a git repo, all subsequent change sets are invalidated and the deltas are recalculated to generate a new history.\n\nSince we have short-SHA strings baked into almost everything we do, it will effectively invalidate everything that uses them - at least, it'll make it impossible to 'go back' to a previous SHA (like what is shown on a certified image tag, for instance)",
