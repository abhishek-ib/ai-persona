      "message": "Hey, there a couple of bugs (or at least unexpected behaviour) that I've noticed with Deployments\n1. If one file in a batch fails a validation, the whole batch gets sent for review (see video where I push 5 files through and yet some don't require review). Making a bug ticket for this\n2. When I update an app, I don't get a notification to automatically update deployments. It feels too easy to me for users to patch an app and not realise that this app hasn't been put into production across all deployments. I feel there should be at least a visual reminder that an update might be required \n3. When pulling down results via API, there is a field `\"review_completed\": false` . After hitting 'Submit and continue' on some documents and then re-pulling API results, the value does not change. My gut is that this is because we have a separate 'Mark as Reviewed' button, but I haven't tested this behaviour",

We have work scoped so that the user will be able to choose whether they want a validation failure in any document in the run to send all the documents to human review (the current default behavior) or for only documents that have validation errors to require review.\n\n2. That's a good point! @Kaustubh (KD) and @Jianqi Xing for this one.\n\n3. As Melissa said, the review for the run must be \"closed\". We have work scoped such that when all documents are reviewed, it resumes automatically.",
