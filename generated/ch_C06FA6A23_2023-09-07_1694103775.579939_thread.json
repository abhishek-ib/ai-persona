      "message": "Hello, please let me know if there is a better place to post this. I need to export a list of logins from an instance of Instabase (23.07.8). When I go to Audit Logs, select the Log type and export to CSV, the headers show as \"0,1,2,3,4\" and the timestamp is not in a format that can be converted to a date in Excel. My specific use case is:\n• Find users (based on their email domain) who haven't logged in since XXXX date. As I can't filter by a specific domain in the Audit Log, I need to export to Excel/Sheets to filters rows by the email domain, but then I can't read the date.",

The directions on Stack Overflow do not result in a readable date format either in Excel. I figured it out on my own, but only after spending more time researching. Seems like this is harder than it needs to be for all of us, but especially for our customers. Is there a way to make this more intuitive and easier for customers (the date formatting and the column names)?",
