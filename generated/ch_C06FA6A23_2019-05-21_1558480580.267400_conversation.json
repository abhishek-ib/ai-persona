I’m not sure how we’re planning to collect all the data and ship to customers so we can test these flows (maybe eventually just copy into one S3 bucket that we mount and test?). Please add a few tests you think will exercise different services (no need to do a full-thorough UAT, these are just sentinel tests to make sure we’re touching each service).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F2hGU3qJTAjh2XeRZZopImYUEgPcEOkovZ0es6iSN4/edit#gid=125103431",
