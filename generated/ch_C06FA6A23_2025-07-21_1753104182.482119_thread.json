      "message": ":robot_face: *IBReviewer Prototype!*\n\nHey team! I've been working on building an AI-powered code review assistant as a side project that I'd love your feedback on & also understand what other efforts are going on in this area whether we may be evaluating any external tools or if we already have fully fledged working ones already in the pipeline.\n\n*Key Features:*\n• *Human-like Reviews* - Uses OpenAI to provide intelligent, context-aware code feedback (not just style nitpicks!)\n• *Smart Fix Detection* - Automatically detects when previous issues are resolved and acknowledges fixes\n• *Intelligent Filtering* - Avoids repetitive comments and focuses on high-impact issues\n• *GitHub Integration* - Properly threads comments, resolves conversations, and provides comprehensive statistics\n• *Duplicate Prevention* - Won't spam the same issue across multiple files\n• *Rich Analytics* - Detailed breakdowns of issues by category, severity, and resolution status\n• *Super Cheap* - Costs $0.0099 USD to review a 5k line PR (One in the example)\n• Fast - 2m 30 seconds to review the PR (which includes setting up the Github workflow as well)\n\n*What it catches:*\nLogic errors, security, performance issues, proper library usage, edge cases humans might miss\n\n*Current Limitations:*\n• Fix detection may have occasional false positives\n• Primarily tested & works with on Python reviews\n• Still refining comment resolution reliability across different GitHub configurations\n• May need rate limit management for large PRs\n• Doesn't take into context any related files which are unchanged or the code tree, just takes the changed files into context individually to provide review.\n\n*NOTE*: This is a quick prototype for now, not fully there yet. Posting it here for visibility, for any feedback/suggestions/concerns, please feel free to post them in the thread below.\n\nHere's (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/72617) a PR where IBReviewer can be seen in action providing reviews. And here's (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LeJePJsGZXYG1oKu77O0T3l6ubMuE_BWJ668Edsg9QI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.vmd4hb8908o) a set of functional requirements & a high level technical overview that I've taken into account for this prototype.\n\ncc @Hari @Balaram @Gaurav Saini @mfichman @Yash Botadra",

Finally, can we compile all the comments into 1 comment to remove some of the noise? That comment can also include a rating of if the code quality is high",

Absolutely, currently it just reviews python files, but can add patterns to exclude *_pb2.py & *_pb2_grpc.py files as well.\n2. No, it won't (atleast initially). It'll neither be able to approve nor stop a PR from merging.\n3. Great suggestion, I was contemplating with how to structure review comments too.\nI'll take all of these into account!",
