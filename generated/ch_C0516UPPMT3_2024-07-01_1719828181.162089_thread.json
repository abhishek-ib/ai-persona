      "message": "Hey, couple of small suggestions on the app run screen\n1. I find it surprising that I have to click run after uploading files. I think this would make sense if I had the chance to upload additional files once I had selected an initial couple, but since the option to upload additional files is removed, it feels like an unnecessary extra click\n2. Instead of showing the generic cartoon image after file upload, I think it would make sense to show the files I had just selected. Sometimes I misclick during a demo and only upload e.g. 1 file instead of 2, and I imagine users will do the same",
