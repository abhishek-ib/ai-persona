For some context, I'm trying to add some keys to the context variable in UDFs pertaining to the input file (e.g. file size, file name, file path, and any other metadata that may be useful). Right now, I have access to the Document / ibdoc object and my understanding is I could use the job id to access the input folder path through querying the database. However,\n1. Is there a better way to access the _input_ path / file?\n2. If not, is there a way to get the job ID from the ibdoc? From there, I'm expecting to make an rpc call to query the file path and read in the data there\ncc @Anil @pauline.comising",
