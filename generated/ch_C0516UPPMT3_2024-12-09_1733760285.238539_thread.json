      "message": "Was going to post this in <#C05BJCNKZAM|> as the UX felt like buggy behavior, but then I realized what actually happened:\n\n*The `Open` buttons have a rather confusing UX.*\n1. I opened the main screen of MT Prod, and didn't see any of my recent chats or projects listed (SS1)\n2. So I tried clicking the `Open` button for projects\n3. I was greeted with this screen which felt like what I should get if I had clicked `Create` (SS2)\n4. This felt like a bug, like the button was linking to the wrong place.\n5. It wasn't until I checked the `Open` button for chats that I then realized what happened.\n    a. I was brought to the most recent chat that I had worked on, which also felt like a bug.\n    b. I noticed that the left panel had all my chats, and likewise the projects `Open` likely had a left panel that I could use.\n    c. When I went back and tried it for projects, I noticed that the left panel still didn't show specific projects that I had worked on, but at least I could drill down into the workspaces and find the project that I was looking for.\n    d. This difference in behavior between chats and projects (`Open` opens the most recent chat, but projects just has a workspace picker) is also not just confusing UX, but also feels like a bug.",

      "message": "Thanks this is good feedback for a homepage refresh! cc: @alagu.\n• Open is designed to open the app and not create a new project; the reason why there is a difference in experience is that we have an empty state in build, but not one for converse. So open brings you to the empty state in build, but brings you to the last conversation in converse\n• We could unify this in the ST by making the build open experience similar (bringing you to the last build project instead of an empty state cc: @Kaustubh (KD) for consideration esp. as we have wanted to get rid of the build empty state)",
