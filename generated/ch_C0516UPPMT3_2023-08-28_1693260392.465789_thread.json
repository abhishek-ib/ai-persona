I don’t know how long it takes to deploy, but long enough for me to ask my wife to check the site on her computer to the same result.\n\nI wonder if there’s something more helpful we could return if a user hits it during a deployment? I know these are probably small time frames, but I can’t say it fostered confidence.",
