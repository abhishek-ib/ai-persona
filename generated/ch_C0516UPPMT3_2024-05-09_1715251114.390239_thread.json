      "message": "Hey, been using the platform in a few demos recently. I’m not keen with the move to the validations to be under the separate tab only.\n\nCustomers understand our process as being 3 steps.\n• Extract\n• Clean \n• Validate \nAnd the current design validation being under a different tab breaks this mental model slightly. I prefered before where we had both views, with some under the clean section in field config. I never used the validations tab and didn’t feel like I missed anything I needed",

However, I’m also conscious I may be the person “who wants the windows start button on the left” (I’m not), while empirical evidence shows it is better off in the middle for the vast majority of people. Do we do stuff like hotjar that shows us heat maps, user recordings, and a/b testing etc for these types of u/x changes?",
