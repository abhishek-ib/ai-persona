      "message": "Hi Venkatesh, by metrics are you referring to Automation Metrics (https://instabase.com/docs/apis/v2-apis/automation-metrics/index.html)? If you you’re correct that you will need to publish to apps dashboard. The publish API accepts ibsolution files but the UI abstracts away the process of packaging a flow binary into an ibsolution to make the process easier for customers publishing flows directly. Your options are to select the ibflowbin from the system repo in marketplace, or to call the API manually to publish an ibsolution. https://instabase.com/docs/apis/v2-apis/deployed-solutions/index.html#deploy-a-solution\n\nHowever, I’d recommend publishing through the UI. Apps dashboard requires data to be in the package.json that is not required by marketplace",

Therefore if clients want to track metrics for already published solutions, should they redeploy those using Deployed solutions to be able to track metrics? In that case, will they be able to track historic metrics for the redeployed solutions?",
