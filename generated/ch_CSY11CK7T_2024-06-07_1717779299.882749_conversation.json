      "message": "Hi team, we've had some discussions about what KPIs we should be using to measure our Cypress progress - some of the metrics are certainly less encouraging than others :sweat_smile: I wanted to share one that I think is both useful and encouraging - the median failure rate.\n\nWe started running Cypress in CI (ty @CJ ) the week of 4/29 [attached as 1st image]. During that week, the median failure rate was *41%* :joy: The graph of failure rates might as well be a random distribution. There was no way we could get any signal from these tests.\n\nWe made the tests blocking in the middle of the next week... and from just those efforts alone, our median failure rate for that week [attached as 2nd image] went down to *11%* :open_mouth: The distribution of failures changed significantly.\n\nDespite the difficulties we've had this week [attached as 3rd image], our median failure rate is now *6%*. Our distribution is steadily creeping to the left. We can now trust that when we see a failure, there really might be something wrong! We still have ideas to make our tests more robust, we're still adding new tests, and most importantly, we're getting value out of our tests finally.\n\nI'm really proud of how we've come together as a team to do this - huge kudos to everyone!!\n\nSource: this page (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/analytics/top-failures?branches=%5B%5D&browsers=%5B%5D&chartRangeMostCommonErrors=%5B%5D&chartRangeSlowestTests=%5B%5D&chartRangeTopFailures=%5B%5D&committers=%5B%5D&cypressVersions=%5B%5D&flaky=%5B%5D&operatingSystems=%5B%5D&runGroups=%5B%5D&specFiles=%5B%5D&status=%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22Passed%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22PASSED%22%7D%2C%7B%22label%22%3A%22Failed%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22FAILED%22%7D%5D&tags=%5B%7B%22disabled%22%3Afalse%2C%22label%22%3A%22ci%22%2C%22labelProperties%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23dadade%22%7D%2C%22suggested%22%3Afalse%2C%22value%22%3A%22ci%22%7D%5D&tagsMatch=ANY&timeInterval=WEEK&timeRange=%7B%22startDate%22%3A%222024-06-03%22%2C%22endDate%22%3A%222024-06-07%22%7D&viewBy=TEST_CASE)",
