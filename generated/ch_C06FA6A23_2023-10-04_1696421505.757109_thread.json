I unfortunately had to handle some family issues and was not able to get it it started within the maintenance window planned.\n\nI’m rescheduling the cutover as follows:\nPREPROD: *Tonight*, 10/04/2023, starting at 18:00 PDT.\nPROD: To be determined. I’ll coordinate with SaaS team to find a time that won’t impact their maintenance windows.\n\nApologies for the delay! All is well, just need to push this out a small bit. Thanks!",
