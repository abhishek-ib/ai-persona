Creating categories for these issues would require additional logic, and closing a parent ticket would necessitate even more complex logic.\n\nTo sum it up, treating each issue individually is simpler and avoids unnecessary complexity. Another potential issue is that if someone wants to know the status of a child issue, they would have to find the parent ticket first, which can be cumbersome.",
