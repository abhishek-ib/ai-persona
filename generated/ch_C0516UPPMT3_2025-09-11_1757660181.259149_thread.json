Otherwise, we'll have to treat every 200–299 as OK, 400–499 as forbidden, and 500–599 as server error requiring technical support. We would like to manage errors more precisely.```\nThe customer is more looking something like:\n• *at the very least:*  for each API endpoint or at least for `Get Run Results`, what is the format of the response in case of error.  For example : what will be the body content, will there be an error code (error codes in the response body not the HTTP status codes)? like, is there any fixed schema their system can rely on, e.g. JSON Output { \"errorCode\":152, \"message\": \"error during file treatment: .pub extension not supported\" }.\ncc  - @Lucile",
