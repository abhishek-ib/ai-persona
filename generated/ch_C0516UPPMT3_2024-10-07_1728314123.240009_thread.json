Haven't seen that one before but would like to know what sorts of customization they have in mind.\n\n#2 is an interesting request - I'll create a ticket from this thread to track it. More detail behind it would also be great.\n\n#3 - not aware of this on the roadmap, though I could see some workarounds to do this using doc classification & splitting into different deployments / workspaces. Could be wrong if it's logged under a different name.",
