      "message": "hey @margaret.tomaszczuk wanted to start a thread for what the behavior should be for autogenerating schema, discussed in this thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0976HB6ZPT/p1755533341370479). following from weiming's work that uses class and field suggestions. we have the following flows seen in ss1/ss2: u can choose to autogenerate a schema when files are first uploaded and no schema exists or u can regenerate a schema by deleting the existing schema and then following the first flow.\n\nI wanted to see what improvements/behavior changes we want went implementing this fully w/ Doc AI. Some questions are laid out below, but wanted to know general product behavior as well\n• should this feature only be allowed when the project has no schema? or do we want to keep the ability to delete the existing schema and regenerate? should it be the entire schema the gets deleted or the class for the doc that is selected?\n• should we do this per file? or all/multiple files? should we run classification/extraction as well?\n    ◦ anant's demo and the way that we come up w/ class/field suggestions now is on a per file basis and in anant's demo we extract/classify at the same time for that file\n    ◦ i want to know if we still want to go with this behavior:\n        ▪︎ generate the schema given a single file, return it and have the user modify/approve, then run classification/extraction as normal for the rest of the files\n    ◦ or do we want to consider some way of generating a more comprehensive schema for all the files?\n• should the backend update the schema directly? or just return the auto-generated schema?\n    ◦ depending on what usability features we care about, it might be best for the backend to return the schema for the frontend to then save in case we want to have the ability for the user to preview the schema before saving/changing the schema (like in the second bullet above)",
