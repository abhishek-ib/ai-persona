      "message": "Hi team,\nWe have been running into a lot of issues with CI recently.  At this point, most remaining issues seem to be related to the following Jenkins issues that may or may not be the same root cause:\n• status updates not reported to Github\n• downstream jobs not reporting to upstream jobs\nWe do not have a root cause at this time, but a Jenkins restart fixes the issues and unblocks us.  So while we are continuing to investigate, we are going to setup an automatic restart on preprod Jenkins every day around 6pm Pacific time.  Please reach out to us at <#C035SLYCJ9X|> if you have any questions or suggestions.\n@shiqi @shaunak @Heymian @Kerry",
