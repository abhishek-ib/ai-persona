      "message": "*Sharing some notes from a call with paying customer number 3 (Termina.ai (http://Termina.ai) by Tribe Capital) for visibility.*\n\nTermina are looking to use AI Hub to get info from pitch decks. They’ve already been using Google Doc AI + GPT and want IB to replace it. They want to get summarised results, display them to users, and allow them to ask follow-up questions. They have built an AI Hub app and started to call it using our run apps API.\n\n• Key Features they want (in order of importance inferred by me).\n    ◦ Being able to read charts from input documents. cc: @Rakesh @Rafal for model dev\n    ◦ Structured data type response from app results. cc: @Bastiane @andy for app runs, and refiners.\n    ◦ Ability to see docs I’ve uploaded from API in the UI (file explorer). cc: @Heymian @hannah \n    ◦ Ability to duplicate app/compare versions side by side. cc: @Eric Han @Bastiane for build\n    ◦ Dynamically configure apps, so that they can use us as Infra as Code. cc: @Bastiane related to the discussion for Labelbox\n• They also asked about few features we already have.\n    ◦ Delete files that are uploaded. We support this (docs) (https://instabase.com/docs/23.07/apis/v2-apis/filesystem-v2/index.html#delete-a-file-or-folder)\n    ◦ Converse APIs - @Balaram @jean, we should share docs once they are ready\n    ◦ Chart generation. cc: @Hari \n@Tom it may be interesting to have your team connect with them about commercial too.",
