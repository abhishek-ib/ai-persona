In this example, the extraction shown in the UI is 'ASOS.COM (http://ASOS.COM) LIMITED' which is correct. However, when trying to validate this result, I found that there is actually 3 whitespaces between the two words in the result. I could not tell this from either the print logs or the UI extracted results view as they seem to shrink the whitespace down to 1.\n\nI had to include some extra code to account for this case when validating which was not ideal but not a big lift. It was more the debugging that took quite some time. `response_dict['company_name'] != ' '.join(Company_Name.split())`",
