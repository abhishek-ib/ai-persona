      "message": "<!here> - quick heads up - the changes for docker base images, and upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 are now on master.\nThis will mean that the next time anyone builds a new docker image (except a few third party images) the service will be using Ubuntu 18.04. I will also send out a detailed write up to share info on how our base images are organized for any future changes.\n\nThe build will also take slightly longer (as the 1st layer of the image changes -- needing subsequent layers to be rebuilt). We have also provided support to rebuild/use old docker image by providing `BASE_IMAGE_UPGRADE=false` as a parameter during build. i.e. -\n```\nmake build-docker --> will build new image based on ubuntu 18.04\nmake build-docker BASE_IMAGE_UPGRADE=false --> will build old image based on ubuntu 16.04 base image\n```\n\nFor every service we now have 2 sets of Dockerfile to support both ubuntu 18.04 (called Dockerfile) and ubuntu 16.04 (called Dockerfile.oldbaseimage.*) before we deprecate ubuntu 16.04 images completely. Hence, when changing the docker files please make those changes to both the sets. We expect to deprecate ubuntu 16.04 images after ~2 deploys making sure everything looks stable on new set.\n\nI am going to push the new images into a test env by monday morning pacific, to preempt any issues. In case of any questions feel free to let me or infra team know! Thanks",
