      "message": "Hello - sharing some feedback related to chatbots.\n\nI wanted to see if a chatbot could be built on top of the ~600 tickets (https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22EPD%20Portfolio%22%20AND%20issuetype%20IN%20(Story%2C%20%22New%20Feature%22)) created in Jira to answer questions like \"Which tickets relate to user permissions?\", \"What are the most common feature requests related to <product area>?\" or for clustering similar tickets. I tried uploading the tickets in table format (both as CSV & HTML with 'all fields' selected in Jira) but queries either failed with a red error message or responses had formatting issues. This may be addressed with the improvements we're doing with tables & Excel this quarter.\n\nI then tried to create a txt format of the tickets, which started to perform better, but saw some accuracy/hallucination problems. For example, I asked 'What tickets relate to OCR?' and got a response with 3 relevant ones and 1 hallucinated ticket (EPD-79549 - see attached image). So, in its current state it's semi-helpful. Here's a link to the chatbot. (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/2e7f3c04-2bf4-48fc-868f-c985c1313f71)\n\nAn Atlassian integration that includes Jira tickets would be great & could be a time-saving  tool for dev. teams- either as part of Search or in chatbots :slightly_smiling_face:.",
