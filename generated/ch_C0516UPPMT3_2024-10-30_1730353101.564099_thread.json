In lieu of typing out the issue, I've recorded the issue and you can view the recording via the link below:\n\nhttps://instabase.zoom.us/clips/share/d2xqwhEIY1NfajG08psYC2LJHP0ia4P0USEHIx-LIN1LbsyvWhD4s9kzbN1_oLwA4wPp5Cefsg5zmdWdHRgxA6j9.Mhod8MmbUvVh2Fbp\nPasscode: FA9ZMf.#\n\nTL;DR/W:\nI am getting some issues setting OCR validation rules at the class/field level.
