      "message": ":kubernetes: Hey team, upon merging https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/57365, the default EKS version will now be set to 1.26 and new sandbox environments will use that version by default. Opting in/out of this upgrade for current sandboxes can be controlled by the `EKS_VERSION` Advanced Arg in cloud console. If you would like to opt out of the upgrade, you can do so by adding the `EKS_VERSION` Advanced Arg and setting it to `1.25` and similarly to verbosely opt in, you can do so by adding/updating it to be `1.26` in the Update flow in cloud console. If your sandbox does not have the `EKS_VERSION` Advanced Arg set, it will default to opting in.",
