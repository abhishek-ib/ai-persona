      "message": "Hey, I just tried out the new app runs and converse APIs (via Postman). Way easier to use and more intuitive than the old ones :raised_hands: Some things I found though:\n1. [Converse] 'List Conversations' returns every conversation in the org. Is this expected? I would've thought it should return my user's conversations within the org only, not sure if there are privacy/security concerns here? \n2. [Converse] 'Ask a Question' doesn't produce a matching question in the UI. I just found this surprising since when creating a convo, uploading docs etc you can see the matching result in the UI\n3. [Converse] 'Add Documents' doesn't have a polling call. If uploading many documents, there is no way of knowing when the docs have appeared in the conversation before you begin asking questions (as far as I can tell)\n4. [App Run] 'Run App' in the Body, I believe \"name\" -> \"app_name\". IB-Context header was also missing. I then got the error below which I haven't been able to resolve\n@Anil @Lee",
