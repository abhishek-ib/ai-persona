      "message": "<!here>\nOCRService has been enabled in dogfood! This has a few implications:\n1. *Tesseract* is now an OCR option in Process Files. It's still pretty basic support (no options or configurations), so let me know if you want to play around with some of it's configurations and we can make that happen!\n2. *Ari* and *Google* OCR's are now going through OCRService. This should have no impact on results, but please report any bugs or differences you find. You can override this and skip OCRService by setting this in the ocr config `\"use_legacy_provider\": true`",
