Are there considerations for - or is it possible to - exposing extraction confidence scores at a more granular level than field?\n> Here, a Paychex use case looks to extract employee information, with associated attributes. \n> Today in the enterprise platform they particularly noted the use of more granular metadata for confidence scoring, and in turn validations - whereas with AI Hub, it would almost be the whole employee list needs to be reviewed (a list could be up to 600+ employees).",
