      "message": "in @Brian’s test project for the AI Hub enablement demo today, he had a derived field that added a new column to a table field\n\nthe original table field (“Transactions” in screenshot 2) does not have year in the “Date” column -> however, the derived field added a year in the “Date” column somehow, and the year is incorrect (screenshot 1)\n\nthe bank statement in this case is from 2021, but the derived field contains 2023 for every value in the “Date” column - could this come from https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1785 somehow? @jordy.vlan\n\nthis isn’t the exact same document that Brian used, but I’ve attached a very similar bank statement below that we can use to reproduce\n\ncc @Nikolaos Kofinas as well since this is related to model performance for derived fields",
