      "message": "Hi team. We want to include PR-based coverage report for the `ibformers` library - this would serve as an additional github check before merging the changes. Currently the tests run on jenkins pipeline, and in this setup we’d have to generate the report there and somehow send it to github. I’m not sure if that’s possible.\n\nOne possible solution would be to move the unittests from jenkins pipeline to github workflow, as github provides some tools to display the generated report. Is this something we can do in terms of possible costs, security etc?\n\ncc @shiqi - when I looked for similar topics in slack search, I found discussion on testmo. Is this something related that could be applied to our repo as well?",
