      "message": "Got it thanks for clarifying!\n\nSo the UX problem I'm trying to solve here is the intermediate step after schema is generated looks a little confusing, in two dimensions:\n• We auto-open the `other` class which shows `no fields exist` message, which feels odd since we just auto-generated\n• We _could_ solve for this without introducing extra latency of classification by auto-opening the schema we just generated (confidentiality agreement in this ex)\n• However, the `no results to display` message on each field + `no documents selected message` in this state is also a bit confusing. What would work is if the `no results to display` message said something like `generating results` in this state instead, and also, keep the doc auto-selected that the schema was generated on\n• An alternative and possibly lower LOE to both of these would be to show a new message on spinny wheel after schema is generated to at least indicate some progress, e.g. `Schema generated, classifying documents...\"\nLMK  your thoughts! cc: @melissa.amos + @Natasha",
