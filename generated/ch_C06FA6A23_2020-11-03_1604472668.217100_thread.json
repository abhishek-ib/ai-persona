They have a requirement to run Instabase concurrently in two different geographic regions for high availability. As we (Instabase) donâ€™t have a setup on dogfood or prod to run Instabase in two concurrent clusters, I have created a separate environment (https://active.sandbox.instabase.com/) with two kubernetes clusters setup in separate geographic areas to simulate Goldman Sachs infrastructure.\n\nWe need your help for a mini-UAT to test out whether Flow, Refiner, File System, and general browsing is working as expected with the new setup.\n\nI have created a mini-UAT sheet for the same: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PhXBnb39jJtAN7-rm6QpIQL9ePcIFhLBvZQVNAO24PQ/edit#gid=3507469\n\nCould I request you to help finish these tests by Friday? Thank you so much for your time.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.",
