I may suspect that `Extract` might suggest that the model is meant to return the information as it is and given that model get the INPUT_COL which is a pure text with some spacings it didn’t get that there is a table in there\n`Return .. as table` might indicate that model need to transform input on the fly\n\ne.g. it was working for me when I used this\n`Extract the statement of comprehensive income as a table. Parse the input text and use a markdown format as an output.`",
