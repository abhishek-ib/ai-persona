      "message": "Hey, I notice that split-classification is often doing too much splitting of files. Generally it works pretty well with smaller files e.g. identity docs, payslips etc. When we put Trust Deeds in for example, they often get split into 3/4 sub-documents instead of being treated as one.\n\nClassification prompts don't seem to make much difference here. I wonder if there should be a separate description for how to identify splits (e.g. \"Trust Deeds are typically 30+ pages and contain sections on X, Y, Z. Include signature pages at the end of docs as part of the Trust Deed\")? Or maybe some way to give a few shot examples to the system to help alter behaviour?\n\nA good example of this we are seeing in the NAB POC here: https://nab.internal.instabase.com/build/01971111-93b4-7f85-b1cb-f5b0a31ba405\n\ncc @Kaustubh (KD)",
