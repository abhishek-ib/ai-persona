      "message": "I spoke to @shaunak about this a couple weeks ago. He said he’d look into increase resourcing (app-tasks, database memory) in dogfood to allow our regression tests to get through all the work faster. The alternative we discussed was setting up a dedicated env for some of our regression tests, but we settled on trying to increase resources first. \n\nOne downside of moving to 6hr deployments is that in a normal engineering workday, if there’s even one deployment failure, eng will lose the ability to test out their changes in the same workday.",

The window length increase is somewhat immediate solution to the cypress pipeline timeouts that we are trying over the weekend.\n\nWhen we are trying increasing the resources, I can revert the window length back to 4 hours.",
