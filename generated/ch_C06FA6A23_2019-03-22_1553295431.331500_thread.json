      "message": "Heads up for those that are interested, there are a few new cool provenance tracking features:\n- Bug fixes (the most exciting of them all!)\n- Auto provenance (available as refiner option) - If provenance tracking is not available for your functions, turn this on and refiner will do a “best effort” find of the formula output within the original record, highlighting the first instance it finds.\n- Freezing - Sometimes your refiner results are just too messy, and so you do some data sanitization. However, this sanitization can be tricky and may require UDFs, so implementing custom provenance tracking can be tough. Now you can freeze the raw data (e.g. `sanitize_fn(freeze(scan(...)))`, which will produce the desired results but highlight whatever came within `freeze()`, rather than the entire result.",
