      "message": "*Human Review Feedback*\n\nWe’re gathering more data on this, but looking for easier mechanisms for reviewers to make corrections to tables. It would be great if:\n• For table extraction fields, if a table is wrong, users could click/select a table highlighted by the provenance tracking on the review interface and have the data from that table be autofilled into the selected table field\n• As a backup to this, if users want to copy/paste data from the table in the original document but the data has more rows/columns than what was extracted, we should be automatically creating the new rows/columns when the user pastes that new data in. Otherwise, they currently need to manually add the new rows/columns to make the data fit - Zoom clip to demonstrate this issue more in depth (https://instabase.zoom.us/clips/share/QPxf5_LYT6iiG5yPZ3yDLA), Passcode: F1Xq$5?=\nCC @Kaustubh (KD) @Jasper",
