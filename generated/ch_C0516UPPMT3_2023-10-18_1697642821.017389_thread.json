Some of these things were already on our radar, but this is a nice little list for us to just hit up.\n\nI think my one question about what you’ve raised is that the typeface weight for headers came from the design team and Pollen as weight:700, so if you have any clarification on that, it would be super helpful for us to adjust it. cc: @alagu.",
