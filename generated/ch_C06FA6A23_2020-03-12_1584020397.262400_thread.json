      "message": "Synced with Will, I observed this behavior that nginx returns logs as bytes. Turns out it’s something related to SSL - nginx was trying to send encrypted content to a non-secure endpoint. Problem solved by rebuildling nginx locally in docker, but we still don’t know the exact reason of why this bug shows up as i was pulling our prebuilt images and this was fixed a few weeks ago. I’ll let Will know again if I run into the same problem.\n\nHuge thanks to Will helping me out!",
