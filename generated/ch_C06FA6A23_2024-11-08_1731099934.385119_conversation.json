      "message": ":wave-hello-goodbye: Hey all! Just a reminder about the Jira labels that the Docs team uses to track our work. _*If you add or remove these labels, it affects the Docs team workflow.*_\n\n• `relnote-needsinfo`: this means that we’ve asked for a release note (or we’ve asked another question) in the ticket. We track this label and will remove it when we get the needed information.\n• `relnote-added`: this label should be added _only_ by the Docs team. We use this to indicate that we have added the release note to the documentation. *This label removes issues from release note filter--if you add it, we will not see the ticket.*\n• `relnote-na`: this means release notes not applicable; this is a backend change, work-in-progress, part of a larger issue, or something else that doesn’t need release notes. It’s fine to use this label if you want, but know that *this label also removes the issue from our filters, and we will not see it.*\nThank you!",
