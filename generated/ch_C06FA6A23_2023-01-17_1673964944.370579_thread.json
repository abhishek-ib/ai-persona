      "message": "Good morning! My python debugger failed to yield any outputs in console when running unit tests. The debugger just hangs and won’t show anything until I kill it. Upon investigation, I found the cause is this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/33496/files) added -b flag to running unit tests and this redirects all pdb output to buffer rather than stdout. I could just temporarily delete this flag in `build-python.mk (http://build-python.mk)` when needed but was wondering is there a better way to debug unit tests?",

      "message": "IIRC the flag was added to make it easier to parse unit test output, so that you only see the stdout of a failing test and not every test that runs (because our tests are super noisy). but i can see that not working well with hanging tests :) maybe there’s a way to set a timeout so that if a test doesn’t pass/fail within x seconds it’s automatically marked as failure? cc @lydia you were looking into python test runner recently",
