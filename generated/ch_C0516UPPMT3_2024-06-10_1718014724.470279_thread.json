We can keep tweaking the prompt for cases but that will be an infinite task and also consumes the required context length we need to respond with right answer. For now we will have to call out this as a limitation and continue.\n\nFor Multi-Step though it's a case where we are yet to find out a way to integrate even the current prevention prompt. There are limitations due to multiple search/reasoning iteration of LLM queries. i.e. if you say don't answer unrelated questions then there is a high chance the reasoning will stop answering them(response we need to answer composite queries) and will lead to accuracy issues.\ncc: @vineeth @SÅ‚awek Biel",
