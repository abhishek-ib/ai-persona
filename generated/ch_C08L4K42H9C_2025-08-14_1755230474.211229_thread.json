There was previous coverage in job_handler.py, but when I submit and continue a deployment run review, the logging isn't triggered. My guess is that the API call for resuming a deployment run is a different API call, but I can't seem to pinpoint it.\n\nI've been using the Network tab on Chrome to see what API call is triggered when I hit the submit button, but the only API triggered when I click it is:\n```\"request\": {\n          \"method\": \"PATCH\",\n          \"url\": \"https://https--charles-auditlogtest-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/api/v2/documents/review/status\",\n          \"httpVersion\": \"http/2.0\",```",
