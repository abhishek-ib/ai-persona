      "message": "Hi team, had a call with VRSF around a customer facing chatbot use case and they had lots of feedback/ feature requests based on an open source tool (https://flowiseai.com/) they are using:\n• Would like to fine tune the chatbot using \"response prompts\" so that it can develop a persona - this means that it will only response in a certain way/ tone and will be able to generate context-based questions for the user to ask\n• Ability for the chatbot to suggest follow up questions for the user to ask - this is important to make sure non-specialist users can get the most meaningful responses out of the chatbot\n• Prevent the chatbot answering non-context related questions\n• Chain the chatbot to a second chatbot that will be able to conduct compliance checks, to make sure that the responses are appropriate and won't cause any reputation of legal consequences\nHave we thought about any of the above before? I will create Jira tickets for these, but @margaret.tomaszczuk it would be great if you could jump on the next call I have with them to help provide feedback/ responses on the above.",

      "message": "Hey @leila.tan! thanks for passing this along! To clarify, they are considering using Flowise (https://flowiseai.com/) to build out chat apps?\n\nResponses inline below!\n\n> • Would like to fine tune the chatbot using \"response prompts\" so that it can develop a persona - this means that it will only response in a certain way/ tone and will be able to generate context-based questions for the user to ask\nThis is actually feature we have spec-ed (jira initiative (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1285)) but have had to deprioritize on model dev side in favor of other more critical items. Great to see signal here and will add to the init. This is not on our Q2 roadmap but something we will certainly consider again in Q3 roadmapping.\n\n> • Ability for the chatbot to suggest follow up questions for the user to ask - this is important to make sure non-specialist users can get the most meaningful responses out of the chatbot\nI have not heard this one yet -- can you share more what they might have in mind here? (and log an init as well!)\n\n> • Prevent the chatbot answering non-context related questions\nThis is already build into our chatbot agent -- have they observed any issues here?\n\n> • Chain the chatbot to a second chatbot that will be able to conduct compliance checks, to make sure that the responses are appropriate and won't cause any reputation of legal consequences\nWe also have built in guardrails in our chatbot agent to prevent against hallucinations and reputational damage. What did they have in mind as far as the secondary chatbot experience? Are they wanting us to actually check the chatbot against another knowledge base for compliance, or more general factualness checks?\n\nThanks!",
