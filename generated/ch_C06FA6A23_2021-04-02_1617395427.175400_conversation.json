Iâ€™m excited to announce that after a bit of a delayed start, we have some really interesting *IB Tech Talks* coming up over the next several weeks! :tada:\nNext Thursday *@Daniel Cahn* will be speaking about his work at the Imperial Data Science Institute applying Deep Natural Language Understanding to understand 300K+ text message conversations with individuals in mental health crisis. He will also be diving into contributions made to deep learning in the course of this work :brain:, including a novel Transformer-over-BERT model; a framework for multi-task learning to improve generalization in the presence of sparse labels; and a mathematical model for using imperfect machine learning models to estimate population parameters from a biased training set.\nPlease join in next *Thursday, April 8th at 8:30am PST* to hear about his awesome work! :pray:",
