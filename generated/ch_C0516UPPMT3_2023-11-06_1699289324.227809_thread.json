      "message": "Hi thanks for making the user name more visible at the home page, there wasn't a quick way to view it previously so this helps a lot!\n\nI feel like the positioning and weight could be a little more subtle for the username. Currently the user's name is right beside the logo, with the same font weight, and the font size larger than the nav elements. I personally felt it a little out of place and guess having it a little more subtle could work better? This will help make it not interfere with the AI Hub brand logo, and help guide user's focus to other more important elements.\nWe can try moving the username towards the right side with other nav options, decreasing the font size/font weight/font color so it's more subtle.  Or we can try moving it to the user profile dropdown, similar to how Google does it.",

You can see a prototype of it here (and designs below). https://instabase.slack.com/files/U03FT35MAHF/F062YKA9770/decide_to_stay.mov\n\nSince we received user feedback that it was not clear what org a user was working in (when in a commercial account), we wanted to start to show this to the user now to set context before we then let them start to use it to switch. The reason why we show personal org here is that this is where a user will be able to switch from their personal account to the commercial account, and also where they will see a CTA to upsell to a commercial org (if they only have their community account).",
