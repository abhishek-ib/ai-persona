      "message": "Hi - The time to first page load for aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com) is still pretty slow. ~10s on my fairly fast connection. We saw that this became quite an issue at the workshops we conducted in the past week, where student were on slower connections and often took upto 30s to get to aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com). Subsequent page loads are fast due to caching.\n\nThis isn't a great first experience for AI Hub, and we should look into optimising this first page load time. Are there any quick fixes we can consider? If people in the US aren't experiencing this, it may be a CDN thing? Our next set of workshops are on 9/6. cc: @Ab",
