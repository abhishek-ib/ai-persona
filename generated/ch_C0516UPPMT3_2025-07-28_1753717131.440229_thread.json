Prompt for all fields\n2. Reverse engineering for classes\n3. Move Fielder order via drag and drop\n4. Create new Field by clone it\n5. Custom function for classification\n6. A Graph requested: How much each run of documents costs per use case for example. This indicates an estimation of how much a use case costs per run \n7. API to automatically import fields and classes and prompts\n8. Re-use single elements like a field from other use cases. Not copy paste manually\ncc: @Filippo",
