      "message": "Hello! While changing some retry logic for requests on AI Hub, I noticed that `refetchOnWindowFocus` is set to `false` for our query client. I wanted to see how people would feel about setting it to true. For Build projects with locks it probably won't make a difference UX-wise, but there are a lot of places it would be really nice and potentially prevent bugs related to users trying to take actions on the same entities.\n\nFor most of the product it would probably be pretty safe to turn it on, but there is the potential that we're doing funky stuff in Build and Converse where it could cause bugs. What do you all think of turning it on for 24.20 and doing some testing to see how it goes?",
