I am preparing a script that will log some benchmark data to cloudwatch and according to my code foo skills (guh chat gpt guh)  I need to have some access keys\n```aws_access_key_id,\naws_secret_access_key```\ndoes anyone know how can I obtain them? Also how they can rename active for “ever” (I will run the script from a dedicated ec2 machine)",
