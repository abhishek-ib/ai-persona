      "message": "Thanks Kerry, understand the complexity here. I think this could become an issue when we begin moving Enterprise customers over to AI Hub and getting through MRM. One of the things we need to prove is that the ‘model’ isn’t going to change over time. Thats either by proving it can’t as its not being trained on the fly, or having a mechanism to continually test performance to detect drift which then mitigate the risks.",
