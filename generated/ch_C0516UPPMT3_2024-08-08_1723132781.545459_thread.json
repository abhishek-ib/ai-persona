We think that allowing them to process excel files natively will be very beneficial for them - and will be critical as they compare us against other alternatives for extraction.

We are working with TDF team to figure out this issue. \n    ◦ PS: If we extract 4-5 columns from the table, then we are able to extract more than 5000 rows\n• While displaying the extracted data, because of the number of rows and columns there is a lag on the front end \nI have created a build project for one of the documents shared by @Dale DeLoy and table extraction looks good.\n\nhttps://aihub.instabase.com/build/01913321-f778-7c8d-8be9-0ba1e23872f6\n\n@lydia Can you please update the issues in the ticket?
