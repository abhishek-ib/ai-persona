Meanwhile, we do have documentation on how to use multipart upload at https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/multipart-upload, though I know that’s not exactly what SocGen needs.\n\n@jean FYI",

      "message": "@Piyush I understand both your and the customer’s frustration, and we want to help however we can.\n\nTo make the docs process completely transparent: the API docs are autogenerated from the `openapi.yaml` spec. We supplement those autogenerated pages by hand-writing docs for API operations that aren’t yet included in `openapi.yaml`. A great example of that is the hand-written docs page you mention above, which describes how to use multipart uploads.\n\nOnce EPD-4670 is done, the spec for the multipart upload operation will be in `openapi.yaml`, and new API documentation for that operation will be auto-generated from that spec. At that point we can delete the hand-written page for multipart uploads.\n\nIt sounds like SocGen is relying on `openapi.yaml` entirely, and not referring to the hand-written docs page? Using that page should allow them to self-serve for this operation, until EPD-4670 adds the operation to `openapi.yaml`. But is there some problem with that strategy, that we can help with?",
