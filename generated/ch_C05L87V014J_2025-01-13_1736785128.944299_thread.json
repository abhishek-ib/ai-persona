I for one like to use Jaeger to debug perf problems locally, but I have to set that up manually. (edited)\n@mfichman i think this will be a bit a more involved, i brought this up to @Kerry this week as well for something we should prioritize in next quarter. The actual service startup is easy, however the configs will take more work. A lot of observability setup is based on k8s primitives for service/target discovery (or log collection etc). So this will be something that will need a bit of heavy lift, and something we will look into prioritizing in Q1.",
