      "message": "A few Friday afternoon thoughts of some small rainy day features that might be useful:\n\n\n• Cron-style Flow scheduling\n• Ability to attach a \"parameters\" file to Apply UDF. Its contents get passed in the kwargs.\n• Code helpers to quickly create Apply UDF of the following form: `extend_row(ibocr_row) -> ibocr_row` . We seem to co-mingle extraction code with transformation code a lot in UDFs. It might be useful to more explicitly separate those steps so we can independently develop and evaluate. (E.g.: Extraction step is to find the messy sentence with the information in it. Transformation step is to interpret that information.... we can have separate development/testing processes for these)",

It’s a Dict[Text, Text] which you can pass at runtime, and then Apply UDF gets CONFIG as a variable which you can reference.\n\nWere you wanting a different feature?\n\nWill likely have to talk in person about extend_row and how we can separate extraction code from transformation code — would like to understand your thoughts better there",
