      "message": "Another quick update: New APIs + Postman collection\n\nThe new API endpoints for app run and converse just went live with 24.16.\nThe new app run is cleaner in that can you fetch the results directly using run ID and the status endpoints returns a clean response.\nAll the new APIs follow REST conventions. This is an improvement over older APIs that would return HTTP 200 and {status:error} as response.\nSee: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C03N2DF2FT4/p1712256528540479\n\nThe AIHub Postman collection has been updated to use the new APIs. If you are using Postman, click on the 3 dots next to the collection > Pull Changes to get the latest updates.",
