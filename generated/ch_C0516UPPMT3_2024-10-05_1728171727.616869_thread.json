      "message": "Been messing around with the search preview and wanted to highlight a finding. I had the following 2 Qs:\n1. Find the solution design prep document for HLL\n2. Can you find the solution design document for HLL?\nThere are 2 documents in here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c9wHKjthyukCZL4Td1dBKyxacf33iyjr), one is just the template while the other is completed. When I asked the Qs above, I only ever got one doc as a response and different docs were presented back each time. Both docs have the same name, same permission so I would have expected both to be returned as part of the results. Am I missing something or is this a gap / inconsistent behaviour?",
