      "message": "Hey team, I discovered the Doc Translation app earlier this week and it has been a game-changer for me! Compared to having to screenshot files and use Google translate which just pastes non-formatted results over the top, this makes comparing documents in English with the originals so so much easier for making demos. A couple of feedback points I have though:\n1. The app doesn't remember your last used languages. This means you have to configure these every time you push through a new batch, despite me often using the same ones every time - https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1872?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZDdmOWVlYTE4MmUyNDI3ZWE1MDAwYzQ1ODkyODQ2ZGMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9\n2. Even better would be if we could auto-detect the input language of batches. Sometimes I don't even know the language of the doc I have so I have to figure this out - https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1873?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNDIzZDVlMDEzNDczNGJlN2EyZmU0NjdjYjNmNGRlY2YiLCJwIjoiaiJ9\n3. The results screen has different PDF viewers and the windows cannot be resized. It seems strange to have the LHS be the AI Hub method of displaying docs and the RHS be the OS way of displaying. This results in different zoom amounts, but then I also can't resize the panels to see the results easily - https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1874?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYzVhYWVkYjU1N2MxNDU5YmI2MWU4NmE3OTQwYjg4YzEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9",
