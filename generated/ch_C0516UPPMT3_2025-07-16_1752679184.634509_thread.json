QQ: NWM is looking to use the Automation Metrics (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/apis/v2-apis/automation-metrics/index.html), Job (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/apis/jobs/), and  Auth APIs (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/apis/auth/index.html) in AI Hub. I _think_ I remember hearing they can still be leveraged with ai hub, but wanted to sanity check -  are they available, or only supported in IB Platform? Didnâ€™t see them in the ai hub docs. Thanks!",
