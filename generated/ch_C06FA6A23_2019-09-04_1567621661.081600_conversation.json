      "message": "<!here> Hi all, I’m about to merge a refactor for front end code that touches almost all the apps. The summary is here:\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/10954\n\nThis is the last of the refactors to move everything to webpacked. We no long have to run babel transform on any static files and no more js-out/static folder.\n\nThe key changes are TreePicker, InstaToast and hovering/checkbox menus. If anything is broken related to these components, please direct them at me.\n\nI’m pushing this early in the release cycle to maximize time for bug finding. Please pull latest master so I can hopefully not break your UI! Make sure to run a fresh make build-local if you’re using the RELOAD=true option",
