Will see if I can at least gather the data for `instabase-public` later this afternoon, if the IAM Policy Analyzer quota is a rolling refresh sort. If not I'll try that one tomorrow.\n\nAnyway, `instabase-build` migration is _potentially_ a higher-impact migration than `instabase-dogfood`, in that it contains our base images and thus is a dependency for all service builds. That said, the migrations thus far have been smooth and easy, so I'm not too worried.\n\nAs always - let me know if you find that suddenly this project's GCR images are unusable for you. :slightly_smiling_face:",
