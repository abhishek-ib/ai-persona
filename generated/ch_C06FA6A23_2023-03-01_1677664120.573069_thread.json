In Colpal's env, on top of installing the package, we should be storing the creds as a kuburnetes secret which can then be accessed via env variables. We have already done this for a hashicorp vault password in one of our previous projects. The same has to be replicated for GCP authentication as well",

If they really wanted to have the data in their own GCS bucket, we could migrate those offline right? Introducing a GCS client library like this is quite disruptive, not to mention storing creds at the k8s level for this purpose",
