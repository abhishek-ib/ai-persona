      "message": "We’ve seeing a lot more Cypress tests failing on aihub sandbox. The most recent ran had 20 failures. (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/14793/test-results) Many of them are due to general slowness of the API endpoint when we run Cypress.\n\nA list of Cypress tests that are mostly passing in CI but are failing in aihub-sandbox:\n• edit-existing-app (timeout - the “open app” button is still loading)\n• create-deployment (the “save” action takes too long and redirect didn’t happen so the tab “configuration” is not found)\n• aihub-validation-udf (api/v2/aihub/build/projects takes 19 secs to load so it timed out)\n• aihub-validation-library (api/v2/aihub/build/projects takes 22 secs to load so it timed out)\n• aihub-derived-field (api/v2/aihub/build/projects takes 19 secs to load so it timed out)\n• converse-app (api/v2/aihub/converse/conversations takes 10 secs and timed out - we overrided wait time to 10 sec from the default 30 sec. Should we increase?)\n• aihub-results-table (api/v2/aihub/build/projects takes 19 secs to load so it timed out)\n• groups (/api/v1/organizations/cypress-jenkins-commercial/members takes too long and timed out - can't find the stat)\n\nTests failed in both envs:\n• view-home-page\n• review-reviewer-dashboard (test needs update since the UI is updated)\n• review-manager-dashboard (test needs update since the UI updates the data testid)\n\nTests failed in aihub sandbox and marked as non-blocking in CI:\n• search-app\n• drives (need to remove this test because the UI it covers has been deleted)\n• aihub-custom-function field\n• deployment-api-instructions (api/v2/licenses/billing-plan takes too long to load so it can’t find the button to start run with api)\n• ground-truth-crud (the action triggered by the “next” button takes forever and end up timing out - idk which endpoint is this)",
