Does anyone know why we use the value `300` as DPI while trying to extract the image from a PDF page? https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/data-services/pdf-services/pdf-tservice/src/main/java/instabase/extraction/pdfservice/PDFServiceHandler.java#L59\n\nThis is actually causing OOMs as the image that gets rendered inside the memory becomes large enough to cause OOMs.\n\nWith the value being `72` DPI everything works OK",
