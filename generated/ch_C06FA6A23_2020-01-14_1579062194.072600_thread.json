Let’s be careful about deleting files in repos (feel free to ping this channel if you’re curious if anyone is using the file still):\n\nhttps://www.instabase.com/ib_eng/tests/fs/Test%20Drive/.flow/ is where we store custom python modules for our UAT tests. Looks like the directory got deleted, but I can recover it since it was simple no worries.\n\nAlso a reminder if we could get help backing up our S3 repositories — would be a nice backup in the case that certain files get accidently deleted - team-infra. Thanks!",
