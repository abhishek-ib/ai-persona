I am also not able to list or delete these via the API, so these are sat there clogging up my converse UI.\n1. Is it possible to make these visible, and deleteable within the UI?\n2.

Interact with API-created conversations only by using the API. Similarly, don't use APIs to interact with conversations created in the UI.`\nhttps://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/apis/converse-api/index.html\n\n• Is it possible to make these visible, and deleteable within the UI?\n*Balaram:* We are working on to migrate the converse app to use the Converse APIs (using DB for document management). This will make the end user experience much better. I will share the timeline here.\n\n• Why are those not visible or deletable via the API?\n*Balaram:* Regarding delete, I will connect with you to understand how these conversations are visible in UI and help with deleting the conversations.",
