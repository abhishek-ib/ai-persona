Then, in your repository, create a directory under files named build/bin, and upload the metaflow files into that directory.\n\n> Once that has happened, you can run the metaflow by following the process here: https://www.instabase.com/docs/content/apps/flow/run-flow.html#metaflow-running-workflows-with-a-classifier (note that this document is on your Instabase installation as well, under Flow -> Running Workflows -> Metaflow: Running Workflows with a Classifier). At the step that calls for selecting the classifier, select “Choose File” and navigate to the uploaded metaflow binary. This will cause your files to be run through the desired metaflow.",
