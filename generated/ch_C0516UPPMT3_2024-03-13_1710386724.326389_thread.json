An example is demonstrated here (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/cbfefd98-2f79-45a0-bdec-9f318952aa69) of a user reviewing claims. The chatbot is preloaded with policies that are shared across users, but each user could have a specific claim they want to use as context to find the relevant policy information. Instead of having to transcribe information from that reference doc into a prompt it'd be nice to just be able to upload the reference doc into the chat and then use the prompt to describe the task that should be completed.",

Did this insight come from a demo you did? The reason I ask is that we'd love to sign someone up as a design partner as we build something like this",
