      "message": "Change to how we build protos for Python\n\nPrior to this PR, we built protos in Python every time we did “make build”. This added a latency of 5 - 15 seconds per “make build”.\n\nTo enhance developer productivity, protos are now built in a separate command called “make build-protos”https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/9632\n\nTherefore, everytime you modify a .proto file, cd into the service which depends on that .proto file, and then “make build-protos”.\n\nI will soon add a pre-submit check that ensures that you ran “make build-protos” if you update a .proto file and forget to update the corresponding generated .py.\n\nTry it out and see how “make build” feels now in Python services!",
