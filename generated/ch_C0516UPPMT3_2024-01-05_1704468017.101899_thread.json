      "message": "Unfortunately, I already went down that line of questioning with sixfold (as it would be ideal state for them to use IB self-contained). Worth noting Sixfold is a generative AI company that's building a lot of this technology themselves.\n\nThey explicitly said they're not interested in using IB to query - they view their value proposition as being able to prime the model with underwriting-specific context (vaguely defined as they mentioned it is their IP used to get more accurate results). When I asked them if they've tried using IB to query they said it performed significantly worse than when they queried using their technology.",

It seems quite straightforward. It also doesn't preclude us from being able to work with them in the future to see if we can build anything with them to capture more value",

Bringing in third party data we can do too.\n\nIt is an interesting position to be in. We could compete with them and win if we wanted to. But their specialization and to a degree market focus makes it more that we would enable them. \n\nI like your direction of thinking to see how much effort it would be to build something that would be more usable to them. As long as it is not exclusive - I see plenty of opportunity for us to use this with our current insurance enterprise customers.",

      "message": "Yes I agree - with their strong market focus, I think we should focus on enabling right now. The best way to do that would be to consider building a transcription app that they can use that allows them to get value from IB. A transcription app is an interesting idea as it allows us to price more effectively for this service too (than trying to hack build or converse into doing this).\n\nRight now, it's very clear they're not interested in partnering us with to build their genAI underwriting app - this is their core tech. Nothing precludes this from changing in the future, or precludes us from building a competing app in the future.",
