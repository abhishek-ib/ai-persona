If you don't have that, the option just isn't present in Deployment Configuration. Imo it would make a lot more sense to still display groups but grey them out and have a tool tip saying why they can't be added\n\ncc @jack.robbins",

Basically the selector for the group would show all the groups in the org, but the ones that aren't added to the workspace will be disabled and we can somehow indicate that it's because they're not added to the selected workspace. We can also always show a link to workspace settings to add groups in the helper text.",
