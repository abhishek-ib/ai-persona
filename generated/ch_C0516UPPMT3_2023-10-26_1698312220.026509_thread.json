This is a kick-off session for them to evaluate Commercial. Build is failing to find any of the values (I suspect because they were found using Advanced in Converse). This is a resulting in a poor experience for the customer as it is not clear why it isn't working and hurts confidence in this being a reliable tool for them.\n\nWhat is the status of making Advanced mode possible in Build, and in the meantime how can we make this limitation much clearer?\n\n@Nico @Tom Deaney @Lee @hannah",
