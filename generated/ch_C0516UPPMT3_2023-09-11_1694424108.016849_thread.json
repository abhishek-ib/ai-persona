Does that mean the team that is responsible for ib_llm_tools is aware that we will need to implement an additional parameter such as `\"advanced_table_recognition = true/false\"`  to the refiner package? Otherwise, I'm happy to write a ticket. We will need the feature shortly after the release :slightly_smiling_face:",
