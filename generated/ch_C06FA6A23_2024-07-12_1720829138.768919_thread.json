      "message": "*[Release Change Announcement]*\n\nHey team, we have some changes to announce regarding the upcoming 24.28-aihub and 24.07-enterprise releases.  In an effort to reduce the number of releases we need to maintain, we have decided to *combine them both into the 24.07-enterprise* release.  As we start shipping AIHub to onprem customers, we need to have a quarterly aihub release that is maintained with bug fixes and vulnerabilities.\n\nMoving forward, the “-enterprise” release suffix will indicate that the release can be used either for the instabase platform or AIHub, but it is a quarterly release that will continue to be maintained. In 2 weeks, we will continue with our 24.30-aihub release with our usual cadence.\n\nToday we will be merging all the commits in 24.28-aihub into 24.07-enterprise.  Once that is finished, we will lock commits to 24.28-aihub, and update the aihub-uat sandboxes to deploy from 24.07-enterprise. Any pending backports need to be recreated to the 24.07 release.",

      "message": "Branch `release-24.28.0-aihub` has been locked, and is now read-only. It will be deleted as part of the normal AIHub / biweekly release cadence in the coming months, but will stick around as a read-only branch in the meantime.\n\nAlso, a quick clarification - to reiterate, the `-aihub` biweekly weekly branches will continue on, and we'll still have one release branch per quarter that we maintain for on-prem. We're not merging on-prem and SaaS into one release branch. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThis doesn't reduce the number of branches we _currently_ have, but avoids us having to add yet another release branch for each quarter, just for AIHub. This merge + one-off AIHub release/deploy is just a snapshot to get AIHub and IB Platform release code sync'd up for the 24.07 release.",
