We should provide a better error message:\n> Deployments can't be deleted if they have active or pending links. Unlink the deployment or deny pending link requests, then re-try deleting.\nBut also, even if you remove all links, you seemingly still can't delete deployments _that have ever been linked_?\nFor example: I can't delete this \"Trash\" deployment https://aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com/deployments/0197cc4d-08e8-70a0-b4b0-bc2c25eaed4f/runs",
