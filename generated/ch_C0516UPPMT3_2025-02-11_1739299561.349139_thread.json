      "message": "UX suggestion: When hitting a file limit in Build develop, guide user to try an App Run instead.\n\nOur client Essor (through our partner Sicolos) was attempting to upload a lot of files in the Build develop interface, instead of running an app run.  After file #217 he started getting errors saying that the system couldn't classify the remaining 20 documents.  He thought of that as an odd number of files to set as an upper limit for uploading, but our theory that we told him was that it related to cumulative file size hitting some sort of limit.  He accepted our theory as the answer, but as an aside it would be good to know what the hard limit of number of docs/file size is in the develop interface.\n\nSince the remaining docs just errored out, instead of guiding the user on what the problem truly was and how to overcome it, this provided a poor user experience to this client user, and further solidified his opinion that our platform is buggy.  Instead, if we could proactively detect this scenario and automatically guide the user a bit more gracefully towards the preferred approach (running mass amounts of files in an App Run), his experience would have counteracted this negative opinion that he's formed.\n\nSomewhat relatedly, after we directed him to doing this in an App Run, Sicolos expressed internal hesitation at outcome of him doing so, due to unpredictability of the fields in an App Run based the issue described in this ticket:\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2900\nSo just emphasizing the impact of that issue in a real world client situation.",
