'1549'\"`. what i'm seeing is that when we get the schema for the project in the `PUT /extracted-fields` call in order to compare and fill in necessary information, that schema has no fields so we're getting this field error.\n\nso again another case of the schema being cleared for some reason, will try to debug this issue cuz it seems like a BE one ://\n\nedit: acc even when u reload the page after this, the GET /schema request is returning no fields and we see no fields on the FE, so this is probably the same issue as 2, it's just happening at diff times ://",
