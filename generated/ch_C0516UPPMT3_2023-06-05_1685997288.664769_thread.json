Where the `monthly_plan_premium = $15` is the second run with the incorrect value.\n\nAdmittedly these are complex docs and the prompts are pretty basic just to test this specific behavior. More complex prompts might solve some of this (I'm going to test that out as well).\n\nGiven how GPT is non-deterministic it might be helpful for the end user to quantify how their designed prompts are performing. Having that feedback could help the end user maintain and improve their apps.",
