      "message": "Did some more digging and I believe all of these are caused by the same issue. During the pollen toast migration priority: 'high' was omitted from loading toasts, which Liam fixed here: https://github.com/instabase/pollen/pull/1159. However, this did not make it into 24.04. The pollen version in 24.04 is 27.1.5, and the fix is in version 27.6.1. Since that's just a minor version difference, we should be okay to bump the pollen version in 24.04 to fix this. I'll put up a PR today to do this. Thank you for reporting this @dg and following up @Sujith!!!",
