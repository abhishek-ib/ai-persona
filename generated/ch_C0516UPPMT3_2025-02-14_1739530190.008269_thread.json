Do we have plans to do this? @junie.dinda @jordy.vlan\n\n_\"I do also think that your benchmarking is a major selling point. But it needs to be published, or at least accessible to your customers. I can safely say that your benchmarking team will be doing more advanced research on these issues than our development teams, but I also know that developers like to dig under the hood and see the evidence. I can tell them you do it, but it basically means nothing if I can’t show them any evidence.\"_",

Though keep in mind that benchmarking every new LLM, VLM, or other technique being hailed in the media is not possible by us, given the limited size of our model dev team. For open-source models, I feel we’re even playing catch-up on some of the newer releases. Another caveat is that  these benchmark reports should not raise the expectation that whatever we benchmark will make it directly into a next product release, but at least convey the sentiment that we have it on our radar.",

We can't run ad-hoc sessions regularly, and we also don't want our benchmarking to get misconstrued or misinterpreted and cause damage within DS teams.\n\nDo we have plans to create assets from this kind of work?",
