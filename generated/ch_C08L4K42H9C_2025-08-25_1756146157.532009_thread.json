      "message": "hi team, I had a question for BE when saving record after some action (move/create/delete). For the `/set-records` API endpoint, whenever an action is made in HR, we call this endpoint with `acted_upon_pages` and `record_mapping_type`. What is the purpose for these fields and are they important? I assume they are for storing some level of history in the BE but not sure what the purpose of it is.\n\nI'm asking because for my new feature, there will be a redesign where a user can make a number of actions before saving to the BE by calling this endpoint, so one example is:\n\n1. user moves page 1 (record 1) to record 2\n2. user reorders page 2 (record 1) to position 3 (record 1)\nIn this case, with the current design, I believe for record 1,  `acted_upon_pages` will be `[1, 2]` and `record_mapping_type` can either be MOVE or REORDER, but not send both in a single API call. So I was wondering if I can ignore `acted_upon_pages` and `record_mapping_type` for now because I see that the endpoint still works without it?",
