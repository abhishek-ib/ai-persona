Still narrowing down to fully understand how its causing the issue and what is the correct bug fix. But also I'm curious how they created this refiner program. As far as I know, the Refiner app prevents you from having duplicate field names. So either they edited the refiner program themselves to create this field with an existing name, or an old version of refiner allowed 2 fields with the same name",
