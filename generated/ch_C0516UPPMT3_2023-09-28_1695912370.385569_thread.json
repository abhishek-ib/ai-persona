      "message": "Hi @Bastiane\nWhen you are referring to partial results are you referring to partial rows from the formed table in each doc.\nAs Eric mentioned, there are two option need to have selected:\n1. Enable multi-page tables and checkboxes (enable this before any documents are uploaded).\n2. Use a prompt like \"Extract all tables\" in prompt phrase and for complex phrases like this we need to enable \"Complex prompt\"\nThe second table at times is picked up - but with 1 item there it does not look like a table, so likely model does not pick it up always.\nFor first clear table - I do see all the rows in all docs from above you shared.\nBtw, I have been testing this on aihub-uat.internal env\ncc: @Lalit\n\nInterestingly when I build an app from the build project and run it on same doc, I get an empty result - that may be something to investigate @Eric Han ?",
