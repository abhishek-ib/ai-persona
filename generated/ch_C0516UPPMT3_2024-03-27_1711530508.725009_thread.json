      "message": "@Serena\n1. Original project was created around 10am UK time, with the actual demo at 3pm UK time\n2. The original project was here: https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/build/30bc7b4e-b943-4c6e-8cd5-e7528d09c8da. The extraction that came out differently was the loss table from the loss run class. I believe this project was deleted in advance of the demo, but hopefully you can still access it somehow?\n3. As above, the prompt to get the loss table returns the incorrect table. The same prompt had worked earlier that day in a different project. Note that no errors happened, it just wasn't the result we were expecting.",

      "message": "• I see that the prompt used for the “Loss Table” was the same in both the original project and the new project (“Return the table of Claims” in reasoning mode)\n• In TDF, the model generates a name for each table entity, and the name is used to identify which table to return for an extraction/reasoning prompt\n    ◦ in the new project, the incorrectly returned table is called “Chubb European Group Casualty Claims Summary as of 18/01/2022_2”, and the actual desired table is called “Chubb Share Claims Summary 2020-2021: Incurred and Outstanding Losses”\n    ◦ i think it makes sense that the model gets confused between the two tables since the prompt only mentions “Claims” (which appears in the name for both tables) and the prompt does not mention “Losses”\n    ◦ unfortunately, i’m not able to check the generated table names for the original project since it has been deleted\ncc @Lalit",
