      "message": "+1 to this \n\nFor the HSBC POV, they refused to allow us to provision k8s requests at the same level as k8s limits. They gave us constraints of 6cpu requests and 32cpu limits. \n\nI tried to configure horizontal pod auto-scaling to accommodate this but observed several errors and timeouts between IB services (I think due to the time taken to scale up new pods) that made IB unusable with HPA enabled.\n\nMy workaround was to fix the number of replicas, but allow each replica to request 0.1cpu and scale up to a limit of 1cpu. \n\nIt would be awesome if we could enable IB to work seamlessly with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, and add HPA to our testing for release to ensure timeouts between IB services during replica scaling donâ€™t impact service availability & performance, \n\nCc @kunal",
