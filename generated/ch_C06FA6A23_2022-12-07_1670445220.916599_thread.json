Instructions for updating your local environment will come soon, but in the meantime I would like to take a quick poll. I*f you do local development*, please react with:\n\n  :one: if you use pyenv to manage your Python environment\n  :two: if you use venv to manage your Python environment\n  :three: if you use conda to manage your Python environment\n  :four: if you use another tool to manage your Python environment, or you’re not sure\n\nIf you’re not sure, try running `which python` to see where your `python` executable is coming from.\n\nPlease reach out if you have any concerns around the upgrade, or if you own any service/module that you think may warrant additional testing beyond unit/golden/system tests.",
