To try to combat this and keep our azure spend down, please delete you sandbox resources when you are done using it.  We are working on other features to help with this (e.g. hibernating), but for now we have implemented a Jenkins deletion pipeline:\n\nAzure Sandbox Deletion Jenkins Pipeline (https://jenkins.instabase.com/job/sandbox-azure-destroyer/).\n\nAlso updated the Azure Sandbox Confluence Page (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1606483977/Azure+Create+an+IB+Sandbox#Deleting-a-sandbox) with instructions for deleting sandboxes.",
