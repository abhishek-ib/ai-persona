      "message": "This is actually not a bug -- the backend doesn't generate confidence score yet for longer documents. But I do think we can tweak the text -- this might not always be the reason why a confidence score is unavailable, so showing it as a reason always is misleading. Probably just \"model confidence is not available for this field\" is enough. cc @Eric Han\n@Lee, we purposely distinguish model giving low confidence vs a model can't provide a confidence score to avoid the case that the value is correct but model can't return a score yet. The score is mostly used later for autovalidation in human review -- to you, what makes sense here? from the eng side the 2 scenarios are different, but want to get your view on what the user sees\n\nIf we mark all \"unknown\" as 0% it might generate a lot of noise.",

      "message": "Thanks Kerry, agreed, with more though it makes sense to differentiate the difference between not having confidence and the confidence being 0.\n\nThe main reason I raised this was the message itself however, other fields are able to get a score, so I didn’t think the length being the reason was correct.",
