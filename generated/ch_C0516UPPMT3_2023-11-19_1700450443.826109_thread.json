      "message": "@Siya @tj.serkes The design still doesn't reflect what we discussed here. As you can see in the screen recording, the color of the icons and the color of the texts are inconsistent. The credit icon is gray 40, and the home icon and other icons are gray 20. the plus icon button is gray 60. The color of \"home\" is gray 60, the color of \"provide feedback\", \"documentation\" and \"log out\" is gray 70, and the color of \"xxx credit available\" is #6D6D6D which is gray 60. The \"projects\" \"conversations\" header is gray 30, which doesn't match the header design for the Pollen BetaSideNav component\n\ncc @Heymian @hannah @alagu",

      "message": "btw, based on the spacing in the design, the avatar will \"jump to the right\" when the navbar open/collapse. To address that, the left padding for both open and collapsed states should be the same. The avatar is bigger than other icons so the padding in the collapsed state has to be smaller to make it look centered horizontally. One way to solve this is to make the context switcher's left padding a bit smaller.",
