      "message": "Hey frontend team, I was out yesterday so here is a quick recap on cypress on-call.\n\nWhat I started working on last week was trying to remove all the `docs` in the db to hopefully speed up endpoints that were taking a long time due to complex join calls. That ended up failing and it deleted `runs` and `doc_reviews` but not `docs`. I raised this to Abhishek so he can debug the endpoint I was using.\n\nIn the meantime, I think the best and easiest solution is to actually just delete all the `docs` and `doc_reviews` from the db. They are only used for the `review` and `solution-accuracy` cypress tests so as long as those tests create new docs for each test, it should not affect anything? I'll have to check with backend though if deleting docs would cause an issue elsewhere.",
