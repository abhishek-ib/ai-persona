And as it is so obtrustive its annoying being there when you’re working on the project.\n\nI was thinking something like the screenshot below, where the first time you open a project where you get ‘edit lock’ a modal pops up to tell you what that means. Then there is a pill in the corner showing your current lock status",

I like your idea of onboarding the user with a bit more explanation on what a read only mode/edit lock means.\nOn the UI indication itself, we need to invest more time on the design as we work towards collaboration.\n\nI'll work with hannah & paul to improve control over the notification.",
