      "message": "Hey team, now that we automatically select the model used in Converse, I can imagine us getting pushback from customers around pricing. Are we considering:\n1. Charging differently for queries (advanced/multistep being charged the same)?\n2. Providing greater transparency around price implications of a query (e.g. showing which model is used for the current query once auto-selected)?\n3. Providing greater controls for customers to limit spend or usage?\nI assume this was considered when bringing this change, so keen to understand how to approach this potential objection with customers:saluting_face:\n\ncc @Tom @Jasper",

There are supporting examples as well that follow what you suggested: explaining it in terms of number of documents being queried and what happens if you enable research mode. The updated Converse documentation will also spell this out and no longer discuss model “selection” and rather explicitly state that Converse determines which model to use. (The same applies for chatbots and their single-document vs multi-document knowledge bases).",

      "message": "Seems like Rosie beat me to this, but adding few details since it's an important change.\n1. Auto model selection will help customers get the best insights from their docs. We've often seen folks try the standard (default) model and be disappointed in the past. With reductions in price we shared in 24.28 (https://docs.instabase.com/policies/pricing-policy-updates) the advanced and multistep models have become more reasonable and faster too enabling this to be a better default for most chat scenarios. \n2. We are introducing a chip on all queries that used \"research mode\" since there will be a quality difference here and multistep pricing will apply. For regular queries - a single doc query uses \"advanced\" and a multi doc query uses \"multistep\". We'll keep an eye on user feedback if they want more awareness about the model used - please flag if you hear any feedback.\n3. Re: greater admin controls, we need to look at this all up for the platform. Heard this in many forms before but it didn't make it for Q3 (tracking ticket (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2116)). cc: @Kaustubh (KD) @hannah",
