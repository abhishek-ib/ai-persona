Especially with memory enabled (due to context being maintained). it tries to restructure the input into what it thinks is the most coherent prompt and responds to that interpreted version (chatgpt also did it sometimes).\n\nWe can get this behaviour changed by adding a note to the tool prompting or model config to not change the intent of the original prompt and \"correct\" it beyond a certain notion of similarity.\ncc: @Balaram",
