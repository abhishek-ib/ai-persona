      "message": "Hi Team, one of our partners asked if we support CICD rollback features. Is this on the roadmap?\n```I would like to request clarification on how to roll back a project within Instabase. It is clear that Instabase has effectively integrated app versioning through the SDLC methodology, allowing for app rollbacks. However, when a significant change is made to a project, it appears that rolling back of a project is not possible.\nThis seems to be a crucial element for further development within Instabase projects. Could you please confirm whether we are correct in understanding that Instabase currently does NOT offer this capability? If that is the case, I would appreciate guidance on how the rollback process works. If it is indeed not available, I would like to submit this as a development request.\n\nThe rollback is needed in the development phase: If you change a project (delete a class or prompts or add or alter any settings or prompts that (afterwards) don't seem to work, you want to rollback the project to the version at the stage before altering the project. Hence the roll back of projects is to my opinion (just like in GitHub) a must in the SDLC methodology```",
