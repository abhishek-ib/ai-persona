Instead it opens up the file explorer with errors.\nhttps://instabase.com/MUFG/file-transfer/fs/Instabase%20Drive/\nWhere should I record this bug? The use case here is for customers using IB to send us documents securely. I need them to login and upload the documents to that filesystem. Expected behaviour would be that clicking that when logged out would take you to the login screen, then once logged in youâ€™d be redirected to that URL.",
