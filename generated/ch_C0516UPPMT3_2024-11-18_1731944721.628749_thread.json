      "message": "We need to be extremely careful -- not breaking existing solutions is more critical.\n\nFirst, we should try to design so that we don't get into these kinds of situations. That's why we have code reviews. With this said, there are times when let's say the initial design isn't and require changes -- we need to design the change in a way that won't break the already built solutions.\n\nThere are multiple ways to achieve that: adding extra optional params which is set to right value in the new function but is missing in the old function and keeping the behavior of the old function.\n\nExample: `format_date(date_string, raise_error_on_invalid_args=True)`\n\nIn this case the behavior would be right for all the new functions but all the old functions would continue to work.  This is just an illustrative example -- not a solution.",
