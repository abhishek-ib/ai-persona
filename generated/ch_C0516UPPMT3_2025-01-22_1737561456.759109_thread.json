So only users with the \"developer\" role or higher would be able to write UDFs, and thus would be able to access secrets in that workspace.\n\nYou can also tackle this with workspace access controls. Dev environments would have access to less sensitive data and only to dev secrets. Then, fewer users would have access to the production workspace and they would be the ones handling sensitive data and using production secrets to run the apps/deployments",

We can however allow users to restrict workspace access to trusted developers and permission secrets to specific workspaces, so only those permissioned to the workspace can interact with the connected 3rd party systems.",
