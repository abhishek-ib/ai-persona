To test it out enable the flag: `Enable generating field name and description by selecting text or a table to extract in Build project`.\n\nOnce the flag is turned on, simply navigate to any Build project and create a new field or edit an exist `Table Extraction` or `Text Extraction` . In the field editor look for a icon under \"Change model\". (See screenshot). After clicking on the icon, select an area on the document. Upon selecting an area, the field name and description should be updated.\n\nPlease let us know how this works across the customer use cases that you have. The feature is still in its early iterations but more feedback will help us get this customer ready. Note that the UX is a secondary focus after we get the accuracy high.\n\ncc: @Vishnu / @danny.lan / @lydia",
