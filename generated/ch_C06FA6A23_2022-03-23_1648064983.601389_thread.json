      "message": "<!here> Hi all, wanted to give everyone a heads up that today’s production deploy is happening at 1pm-4pm and there will be some extra disruption since we need to recycle credentials that were leaked in the security incident mentioned in the email yesterday.\n\n• We will be rotating database credentials to our production and dogfood/uat/local databases. Everyone will need to update their branches, and rebase to latest on master on any release branch to pick up the password change.\n• We will be redeploying prod, dogfood, uat, and all our major release sandboxes\n• We will be revoking a couple of leaked AWS keys thurs evening, including the primary ones used by many of our mounted drives today. We will be walking production and dogfood db’s and updating these AWS keys in any mounted drives. To do this, a backup of the db’s will be taken at 1pm. The script will run on this backup and the updated dbs will be put back into production by 4pm. *T_his means that any changes you make to the DBs between 1pm and 4pm may not_ be persisted, you may lose your work!* \n <#C038JGWECV7|> will be updated with progress of the deploy.",
