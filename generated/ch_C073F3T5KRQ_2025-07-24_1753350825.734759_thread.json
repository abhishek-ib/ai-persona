      "message": "Btw, there was one more problem: the old design had json files with lists in them. Major performance problems as the list grew - required reading the whole (large) json file back and writing it again just to append a single entryâ€¦not scalable \n\nThe immediate fix was to start splitting/chunking JSON files, but that was very complex. We moved it to the DB in the end.\n\nI wish Jessica was still around to corroborate, but I think Serena remembers that too (?)",
