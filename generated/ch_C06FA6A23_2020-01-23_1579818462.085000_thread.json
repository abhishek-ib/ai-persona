      "message": "Hello everyone! With https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/12363 getting merged, you are now able to run the nginx service locally which allows developers to forgo the old local proxy script!\n> Make sure at least `webapp` is built and running. For best coverage, build and run other services as appropriate, like API_SERVER and APPS_SERVER.\nFrom `webserver/server-nginx`, run `make build-docker run-docker-proxy`. You can now visit http://localhost, make API calls, etc. Please check it out if you typically do local development that requires multiple IB services behind the single endpoint, if you run into issues, need help, or have feedback, please let me know! Thank you @dlluncor for helping me test it and updating make targets!",
