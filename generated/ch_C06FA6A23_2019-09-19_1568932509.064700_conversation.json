      "message": "<!here> just FYI. We will be rebuilding all our base images for the upcoming release.\n```\nWhat does it mean for you?\n- If you use docker for local development, your builds will take a loooong time the first time you build after base image rebuilds. All subsequent builds will be faster and back to normal speeds.\n```\n```\nWhy do we build base images often?\n1. To fix security vulnerabilities. Ubuntu has a new high security vuln. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14835\n2. To receive periodic updates from Ubuntu.\n```\nPlease expect these base images to be updated at least once every one month.\n```\nHow can we reduce pain for developers who use docker for development?\n- We will investigate whether developers can use prebuilt docker images for their local development.\n```\ncc @Handsome Dave, Will (avoiding a mention for Will since he is OOO)",
