The response from the refiner script has less useful data in it and no provenance tracking.\n\nI’m trying to figure out what exactly makes these calls different? Also wondering if anyone could share what the OCR settings are on AI Hub Converse since maybe that’s the difference?\n\nVerified it’s the same document, hitting the same aihub environment (aihub.uat), same user account, ibllm version",
