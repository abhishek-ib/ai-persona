      "message": "Hey team. Need help finding answers to the following Qs for a customer security questionnaire (answers currently not in our RFPIO - but will add them in once received.)\n\n• From the perspective of all types of in-scope user roles navigating the application, approximately how many dynamic pages in total are there? \n• If such web services or remoting endpoints are exposed, how many methods / operations are there?\n• For such web services, can documentation or test harnesses detailing how to create well-formed requests be provided?\n• On what technologies / programming languages is the application built? (ASP, ASP.NET (http://ASP.NET), J2EE, C/C++, etc)\n• Does the application utilise 3rd party frameworks or APIs? (Dojo, Spring, GWT, etc)\nCC @Mark @Vishnu Nair\nCC - @Eric Han or @Kerry are these Qs you can help with?",

      "message": "certainly an unusual line of questioning. it seems like they are worried about our app exposing web services to the internet that can then be exploited, and they are trying to understand our attack surface.\n\nfor the first question, perhaps we can characterize instabase (from the perspective of user roles navigating) as a single \"app\" or \"dynamic page\" (not sure if they consider those things the same).\n\nfor the second question, we can then say that this app does not expose underlying web services outside of the app's environment, which the customer controls. consequently, all the questions about methods exposed and well-formed requests can be N/A.\n\nlast two questions probably need to be answered regardless.\n\n@Kerry do you think this is a reasonable interpretation?",
