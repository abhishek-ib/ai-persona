      "message": "Hey, I'm working on a Natwest POC where we need to do a lot of signature checks. I'm noticing particularly poor performance on these (https://aihub.instabase.com/build/0197bfe2-2b88-77e3-8c0d-8072e7ffee85) tasks with the tools we have available:\n1. Reasoning - Signatures often confused with handwriting, or if text is in the doc such as \"Signature here:\" or print names e.g. \"John Doe\" this is mistaken for signature presence \n2. Visual Models - quite poor performance here. In this example the model can't identify wet signatures. The visual models also really struggle to look at more than one thing e.g. 'Are both signatures present from both parties'\n3. Confidence scores for visual models are consistently low. They don't seem to correlate to correctness as well\nThere must be some ways we can quickly improve this performance\n\ncc @jordy.vlan",
