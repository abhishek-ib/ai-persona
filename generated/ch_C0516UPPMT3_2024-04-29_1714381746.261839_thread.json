      "message": "hey, right now we are limited in clean prompt functionality for tables, list of objects and list of text and we cannot guarantee that sorting and aggregation operations will work. this is due to the fact that list/table fields can be any length, and we must split them up before sending them to the llm for cleaning to avoid overflowing context limits. this is why you see the ordering happening correctly in segments, but not all throughout. the longer term plan is to be able to handle such operations.",

To confirm, your use case requires table-wide operations like sorting or aggregation? Looping through rows and cleaning at the row level is already supported, so if you're seeing issues with that, then that's a bug we should fix.",
