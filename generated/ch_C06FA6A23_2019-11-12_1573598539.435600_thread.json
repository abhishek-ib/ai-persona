Even though /in theory/ it's all the same, we have to navigate the fact that `page image != record` in terms of bits on disk... e.g., when a record is 2 pages, we need to make sure the front-end is showing the right two pages, visually, to the user.\n\nWe're looking for examples of flows that use interesting Map Records steps.\n\nHave you ever written a flow with a custom mapper? A link to that flow is exactly what we're looking for",
