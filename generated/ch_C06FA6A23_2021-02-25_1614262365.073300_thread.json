There are many competing priorities, and they are typically decided on at the start of the quarter (barring any major new information).

Even for FormRecognizer to be effective, we need to be able to access the right segment of the document, or its post-processed component/segment. It would be hard for PMs to be able to know all these details, without having spent time building real customer applications, and this has to be pushed by Eng Leads.",
