Only if a client or partner already knows how to run large, microservice software platforms in OpenShift would it possibly be successful.  In OpenShift/client-managed, we simply provide requirements about what needs to be set up and how a software deploy works.  We do not do any of that for them.  The client truly manages their infrastructure and Instabase deployment.",
