      "message": ":pull-request: New CI workflow with :github: Action: most of you might have noticed there are more github checks on your PRs for the last month or so, it is our new CI job based on github action runners under beta period, we want to share with you that starting next week we will switch the required PR check to `CI Job PR Status Check` for the following branches (and future release branches)\n• master\n• release-24.07.0-enterprise\n• release-24.32.0-aihub\nthis has been running side by side with jenkins CI for the past month and we got enough data to show the results are in par with jenkins CI in terms of correctness and for long running PRs this can save up to 60% of run time than jenkins CI.\nAlso this will allow you to rerun only the failed test sets and read logs from github instead of jenkins.\nif you have any questions or concerns please let us know in <#C035SLYCJ9X|>, thanks",
