      "message": "Build feedback - *Selection mode:*\n• This feels like a great way to start off creating a brand new field!\n• Though sometimes, the name and prompt it comes up with aren't great.  For instance, see SS1, where the description better describes all of Part 1, not quite line 1.\n• When used on an existing field, this feature could make the prompting better or worse; it currently feels like a toss-up.\n    ◦  I know these are early days with this feature and it'll likely get better, but even a more mature feature like `Enhance prompt` for Document reasoning sometimes (though rarely) makes things worse.\n    ◦ So *feature request*: this has likely been discussed in UX design discussions, but some sort of undo or revert changes button would help save situations where someone doesn't think to copy their prompt/description before using a feature like this.  It'd also be helpful when manually trying different prompts to attempt improvement.\n• Often the name of the field that it chooses isn't one that I would like.\n    ◦ This gets into an overall distinction in Build that has bugged me: *often there's a naming convention for the fields to best provide consistency and compatibility with downstream systems, but usually that convention doesn't align with a name that makes for a good prompt to extract the intended data.*\n        ▪︎ This issue isn't unique to this feature, but if I have an intended name for a field then use this feature, it'll likely rename the field to something unintended.\n    ◦ The only workaround that I know of would be to then create a derived field with the intended name, and copy over the output.\n        ▪︎ However, there is no way that I am aware of to make a field in Build a hidden field (the legacy Refiner method of using double underscores before a name gets rejected; see SS2), so then the output would feature 2 fields for this extracted data, 1 named as intended and 1 unintended.\n    ◦ I recognize that the words used in a name is important to reliably prompting the model to extract the intended data, so if it is not already planned, here's another *feature request:* Add a way to specify a distinct name for organizational and output purposes that can be separate from the name used to prompt the model.\n    ◦ Relatedly, another *feature request* if not already in the backlog: Add support to designate certain fields as hidden in Build.",
