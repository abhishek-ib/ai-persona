Certain models have different sorts of parameters and output that we can leverage to provide debuggability",

Is the goal:\n1. to provide a set of specific models (pre-trained W2, 1099, and 1040 models) which our customers can then tweak/update using our tools, or\n2. to provide a general set of tooling with which our customers can build/train their own models without in-depth knowledge of how DL works (ie. NatWest wants to build a model that understands their internal documents)\nOr is it maybe a mix of both?",
