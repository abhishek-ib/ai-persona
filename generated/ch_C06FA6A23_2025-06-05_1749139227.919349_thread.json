      "message": "1. There is no backup. To add a back up, we’d have to add another payment processor. And I don’t think we are going to do that. However, I did suggest to Victor that we do the Stripe set up in the background so that doesn’t block any user facing actions. Currently, if Stripe is down users cannot create an org.\n2. There is one and only one endpoint for Stripe (api.stripe.com) and there is one and only endpoint for Metronome (api.metronome.com). We do not have control over these endpoints.\n3. We cannot change either endpoint; see #2. We can, however, disable both Stripe and Metronome by clearing their API key environment variables. Maybe that’s what you mean…? Bit confused about this question.",
