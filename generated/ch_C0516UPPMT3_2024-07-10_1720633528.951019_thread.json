      "message": "Hi team, we had a call with Loctax (commercial customer) CTO and engineers. And here’s a quick summary. cc @Ben Wood\n• Main use case: process corporate tax documents especially indirect tax returns (VAT). They have integrated AI Hub into their platform and as part of their process of onboarding customers, they upload and extract data from historical tax documents. In the future, they hope to do so on a regular basis e.g., monthly or quarterly for each of their customers.\n• They currently support 38 counties and want to eventually expand to all OECD countries. This is why addressing the 50 sample document limitation is critical for them cc @lydia @Kaustubh (KD) \n    ◦ In the UI, we suggest that users upload five files of each document type as a starting point. Since they have 38 classes, they can only upload 1-2 documents per class.\n    ◦ They tried creating two projects, one with fewer classes and more sample documents, the other with all 38 classes and only one sample document for each. However, introducing new classes into the latter project tends to result in misclassification of existing documents/classes. I explained how split classification works to them but this is a major pain point as they scale.\n    ◦ Customers are still unclear whether or not uploading more sample documents could help. More education / guidance is needed.\n• Variation in languages and document types is another major challenge for them. For example, they need to be able to detect greek alphabet which is now a gated enterprise feature @hannah \n• Consistent feedback about allowing users who collaborate on a project to be able to publish a shared app version or branch an app version. @hannah",
