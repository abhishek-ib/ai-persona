Which team owns it today?\n\nThis UX component is used in so many places across the platform and plays a critical role in the usability of the whole platform for every Doc Understanding Use-case we tackle. We're starting to see a slight splintering of this UX with the new Annotator App / Blueprint / \"Classic\" Doc Preview.\n\nBecause this is such an important component, used in so many places, when it bugs, breaks or is hard to use, it can make the whole platform feel a bit clunky and unstable.\n\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/CV8V33RPV/p1610722409003900\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C01PQ7Z7T8X/p1620216580408100\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/CJ7E9RG7Q/p1619422821129900\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/CLBGA5A7K/p1620153238306500\n\nCC @Lee @Venkatesh @John Hung @Kerry @Travis",
