Eng leads and PMs are going through all the tickets to triage and prioritise.\n\nCurrently, we have a lot of feedback and bug issues to work through, and will definitely appreciate a signal if any PFR is a blocker for v0 launch. We will continue working through the backlog of PFRs through rolling releases (monthly) for AI hub.",

      "message": "can we do this for all aihub feedback which has worked well for solution builder?\n\nBefore v0, instead of having people write PFRs themselves, just write what they’re observing and what their suggestion is in a slack thread here. One of the eng lead/pm ask questions about the request in the thread. If it’s something we’ll do, we can create a ticket right away and track in our epics for v0.\n\nIf it’s a big set of asks, this can go in a google doc. But it’s important for feedback raiser start a new doc if they have more things to say after we’ve already triaged the original doc.\n\nAfter launch, we’ll still use the same process of raising threads here and we’ll create PFRs for bigger asks and just project tickets for smaller things.\n\nThe advantage of keeping the origination of issues in 1 place and have 1 set of people be aware of what exists is to prevent duplicate tickets from popping up and having too many different places to keep track of.",
