      "message": "Hey team, JPMC have a use case where they would like to import their own custom PyTorch model into Instabase (they are on 21.4) - it has been trained on CPUâ€™s and is very small (tests are <2 seconds for 600 or so predictions). Am I correct in thinking we can deploy the PyTorch libraries to JPMC and this would work? Any recommended advice would be great.",
