      "message": ":zap: :zap: :zap:\nHowdy - I'm going to be using the *GCP* instabase-dev project as the initial test case for migrating from GCR to GAR (Google Artifact Repository), as GCR is officially in < 7 months.\n\nI think the process will be largely a no-op, but I need a testbed for walking through the steps as defined by GCP's docs and verifying my assumptions thereabout - and I think `instabase-dev` is the right place to do so. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*THAT SAID:* If you have GCR images in the `instabase-dev` project (ie: gcr.io/instabase-dev (http://gcr.io/instabase-dev)) that you still need for some reason, I'd suggest you get those moved to *ECR* as soon as you can.\n\nFor now I plan to stop short of doing the full cut-over that will point `gcr.io/instabase-dev (http://gcr.io/instabase-dev)` to their new Artifact Repository backend, but when I do there might be some downtime while the URL update propagates, I'm not clear on that part yet.\n\nI'll update this thread if there's anything that seem critical to the larger org, but otherwise I'll be updating in <#C035SLYCJ9X|>.",
