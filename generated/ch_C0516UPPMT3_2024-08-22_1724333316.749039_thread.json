      "message": "*Overlay OCR Confidence Heatmap Feedback*\nLooks really cool, my feedback is:\n1. Even when I was looking for it I couldn't find it (you have to select a file to preview to see it, which I have actually never done before it turns out)\n    a. Maybe be default we should auto-select the first file to preview so that customers can make use of these and see digitisation settings making a difference (in general not just for this feature)\n2. The grey text of the left hand pane below the colours is too hard to read. It should be made black\n3. Its hard to map the OCR view to the document view. It would be much more powerful if the overlay was on top of the doc image rather than the OCR output (I realise this is a much harder task though)",
