I’m on my local instabase which should be same as master from earlier this morning, i copy pasted a flow, changed the OCR type in Process Files, then changed OCR config and save it. when I open Process Files settings again, nothing changed in the OCR config (it’s still what it was before). Reproduced on dogfood: https://dogfood.instabase.com/apps/flow/edit/felicia/my-repo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/Scan%20Box%20Cross%20Testing/flows_abbyy/process_and_map_limited_settings_abbyy.ibflow#\n\nI’m not sure if this is an instabase quirk (but it actually works under the hood) or if this is a bug. If this is a bug I can create a JIRA ticket",

Those two fields are what’s necessary for provenance and above the config there’s a ‘Allow confidence tracking’ selector. This selector overwrites these two settings.
