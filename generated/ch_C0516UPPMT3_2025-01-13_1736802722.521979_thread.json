      "message": "Hi team! *Secret management + runtime configs* have been deployed to the UAT environment as *internal opt out* and are ready for you to start using and testing.\n\nIf you've ever hardcoded an API key or password into a custom function, *secret management* is for you! As an org admin, you can go to \"Secrets\" within settings and define a secret, its value, and which workspaces should have access to it.\n\nThen, you can use *runtime configs* to actually access them in your custom functions. Within Build, you can define variables for your custom functions (validation, extraction, or clean) to use, and their values for testing the functions. Then, you can customize the values when running it as an app. Once you create a deployment, you can specify what the values should be whenever it's run, and also use those keys and new ones for downstream custom function integrations.\n\nDocumentation will be coming soon, but we want to start getting your feedback ASAP. Please send any you have to <#C0516UPPMT3|>, or if you need help using it, <#C05BJCNKZAM|>.\n\nPM: @hannah\nDesign: @Natasha\nDocs: @melissa.amos\nEng: @Jessica, @Elan Sharony, @Sayan",
