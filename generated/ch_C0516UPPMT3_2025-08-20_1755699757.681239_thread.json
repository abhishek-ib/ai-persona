      "message": "Hi team,\nfeedback on the table extraction\nCustomer tried to extract the recent 5 transaction details from the document consisting of transaction history table. The table spans across multiple pages.\nFindings from different field types and prompts\n1. Using Table extraction : Extracted  the transactions somewhere from the middle of the table. (transaction dates should have been 27/12 but extracted 9/12)\n2. Using Document Reasoning:  Extracted correct data in a plain text format (customer wanted this in a tabular format)\n3. Using Document Reasoning but asking to return in Tabular format: Extracted  the transactions somewhere from the middle of the table. \nIt seems like with TDF it is not able to extract the right data. (I might be wrong in my understanding)\n\nWith option 2 and using `clean`  we are able to extract the field in required table format. But just wanted to share the customer reaction, as they were thinking something is wrong, as the same prompts were working fine in the Converse for them.\nCC - @Atinder @Serena",
