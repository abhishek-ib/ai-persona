For Example: After which step exactly in a flow, a file is considered for num_of_files_processed? Because GS has some flows which use only the Apply UDF method and those flows do not show up in the Graph metric when we see num_of_files_processed.*\n*cc: @Varun Nandan* *@Vikesh Chopra* *@Mohit Wasan* *@Vishal*",
