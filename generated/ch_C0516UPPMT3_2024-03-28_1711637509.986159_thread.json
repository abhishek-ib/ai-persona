      "message": "I ran into a pretty severe old-world/new-world incompatibility issue yesterday when trying to set up a load test for the translation container.  I created a new org using /apps/admin so that I could have an isolated place to put a flow and run performance testing.  At that point, it took my account and the other two accounts I added to it and changed the aihub org for them.  Removing the additional org does not put these accounts back in the original org so they are stranded at the moment.  It would seem that the way we reused the filesystem components to do user/group management significantly limits mixed scenarios between enterprise use cases and AIHub use cases.  Is this a short-term update so that AIHub could get shipped or is this the plan moving forward?",

Then I set up builder, added sample files, and started a flow\n6. When I went back to AIHub, the org showed the name of the new organization space I set up (also saying I didn't have any credits)\n7. I went back to the admin interface and deleted the new space I had created\n8. Going back to AIHub, I now get an error page from the platform styled in the non-AIHub manner\n9. To get out of the account, I have to type in a legacy URL (/apps/admin) and logout\n10. Logging in as a different account works, but the other accounts that I had added to my new space (now deleted) seem stranded",
