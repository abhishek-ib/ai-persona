      "message": "Small design nits:\n1. The empty state illustrations for the Deploy and Review tabs are the same but different from the Create tab. Wondering if we should either use 3 different ones or use the same one for all 3 tabs\n2. The review dashboard loading state shows the table while the empty state doesn't show the table. When I look at a ws without any review tasks, the UI jumps from a richer view (with table) to a very empty view. At first glance, it seems like the UI was broken... I wonder if it's better to show the table columns/search input along with the empty state",
