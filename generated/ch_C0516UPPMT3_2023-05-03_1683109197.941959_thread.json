E.g. don’t return the JSON inline, return it as an attachment.\n\nAnd if we structure the information then why not make it possible to generate a chart, e.g. a bar chart showing income vs expenses. Or a chart comparing each of the docs uploaded, e.g. a financial analysis between companies and show how they relate. Enterprise use case likely won’t need that, but for professional that would be very helpful",
