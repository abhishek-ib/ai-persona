      "message": "Hi team, running into a UI/UX issue with folders that contain many files (enough to require the Load More button) being pressed, and folders within them (i.e. a folder contains folder `zzz`  and files `file0001`  through `file5000` ). When attempting to copy a file into the nested folder, the UI will not display that folder in the copy interface. When attempting to manually navigate to that folder, copying into that folder is not possible as the paste button is grayed out. (relevant ticket (https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/8033))",

      "message": "Hey! This isn't a great solution, but it should work - that list of files/folders is an infinite loader, which means that if you scroll down to the bottom more will be loaded. Soooo you should try scrolling down to the bottom... and scrolling... and scrolling... until that folder loads. We also sort the nodes by type, which means that once that folder loads, it will be at the top of the list, so you'll have to scroll back up to check for it. Sorry, I know it's not ideal!!",

      "message": "Tested and confirmed that, thank you :slightly_smiling_face: . I think the customer folder could be upwards of 10-15k files, so for now the workaround I’ve suggested is to recreate the end file structure externally and copy in such a way as to merge folders, but if that does not work I will recommend this.\n\nLong term, is it possible we could look to add the existing “Load All” button to this interface that is present in the File Explorer proper?",
