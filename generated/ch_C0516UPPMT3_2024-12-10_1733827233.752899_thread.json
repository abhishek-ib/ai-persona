The \"Add members\" button doesn't seem like the button to click when you want to add a group to a workspace. Are there any plans to simplify the workflow?",

Maybe we make a separate \"Add groups\" button beside the \"Add members\" button @Jessica\n\n I see that you clicked the \"Add groups link\" from the deployment configuration page which means that is working.",

It's fairly common practice to lump all under members based on our analysis of other platforms.\n\nWe'll keep monitoring for feedback like this and see if any changes need to be made!
