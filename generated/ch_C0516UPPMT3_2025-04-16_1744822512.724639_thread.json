Also, since human review teams ultimately will be the source of truth in production, many want the same individuals setting those ground truth values.\n\nThe development team could set the app version visibility to private though if they don't want these accessible to the reviewers (this has some drawbacks), or separate the ground truth datasets & accuracy tests into workspaces the reviewers can't access.",
