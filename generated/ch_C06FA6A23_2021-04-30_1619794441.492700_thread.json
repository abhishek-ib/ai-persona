      "message": "Unfortunately more UAT testing coverage would not have fixed this - after getting this short-term fix in, we found it was a deployment bug where stale container image tags were causing the cache to not be invalidated, which was why it was triggered seemingly at random when there were no code changes that should've caused it, and why we weren't able to reproduce on other environments.\n\nThis is one of those cases where UAT couldn't have saved us. We do plan to get people in a room to talk about how we do caching more broadly and look into this problem more. Please trust that when things like this happen we're doing everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen again :slightly_smiling_face:",
