      "message": "Hi, not sure of the best place to post this. When you click the refresh button in FilePicker it resets your path to the path that the FilePicker opened to. Rather than refreshing the contents of the currently viewed folder.\n\nMy expectation here is that it just reloads the directory iâ€™m currently in. I often go to open or select something in an app using filepicker and I notice that the directories or files need moving before I do this. So I open a new tab make the changes on the filesystem and then go back to the app with the open FilePicker, hit refresh to see the changes that I just made in that directory.\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/5ddb5394bc20495c9c14e7562281ca62",
