We have a pretty packed agenda, but will try to do a bit of a Q/A at the end of the meeting if there are things that people want to discuss. Grace put up a poll last week here: https://instabase.workplace.com/groups/yepyepyep/posts/544351623658587\n\nIf there are questions/issues/concerns that you want me to address, please put your questions in or vote for the ones that are already there. I don’t want to spend too much time in a big meeting discussing things unless it’s useful for you guys, so your feedback is helpful here.",
