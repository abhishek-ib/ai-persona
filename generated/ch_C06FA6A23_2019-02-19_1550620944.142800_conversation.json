Theoretically you should see no change once you pull down the latest version, so let me know if that is not the case.\n\nTo switch over to using launcher locally, go to the Application tab in your developer tools and add the `use_launcher` cookie with a value of `true`, and refresh. Just set it to `false` if you need to switch back for any reason.\n\nI'd really appreciate it if people could switch over to using it so I can start getting feedback and squashing bugs :slightly_smiling_face:",
