      "message": "Thanks for clarifying @Serena.\nI have tried the approach you suggested, there are couple of problems when we move the `documents`/`chats.json` files to the newly created builder project.\n• `documents` folder has the `out` folder in it with the ibdoc files, which still references to the original filepath where these files are generated\n• `chats.json` refers to an exact path from the `documents` folder and when copied to a new environment, it’’s unable to read the files based on the json. (attaching screenshot from `chats.json` file)\nApart from this, I was trying to copy over the same flow/refiner to a newly created flow but the flow’s not able to load the goldens as expected (even if the goldens folder is present in the same folder, attaching the error screenshot)\nLink to the flow: https://aihub.dev.instabase.com/apps/flow/edit/ib-se-apps/my-repo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/a[…]7-870a4e69654e%2Fflows%2F1684234178770%2Fcodelabs.ibflow= (https://aihub.dev.instabase.com/apps/flow/edit/ib-se-apps/my-repo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/aihub/c4c47a32-8cdb-409f-87a7-870a4e69654e/flows/1684234178770/codelabs.ibflow?%2Fapps%2Fflow%2Fedit%2Fib-se-apps%2Fmy-repo%2Ffs%2FInstabase+Drive%2Faihub%2Fc4c47a32-8cdb-409f-87a7-870a4e69654e%2Fflows%2F1684234178770%2Fcodelabs.ibflow=)\nIs it because of the `goldenPath` present in the `lastRunParams` of the ibflow file which is referencing a full path from the previous env?",
