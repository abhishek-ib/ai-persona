It can be a subset of test that we run. Our goal is to test thrift connectivity between services. Our customers are waiting on this change and we need to fast track this work.\n\nWhy did we not catch this security vulnerability earlier? Unfortunately, this problem was diagnosed by the tech community after our UAT had completed (around Oct 29th, 30th mark).",
