      "message": "Clusters pull by virtue of residing in the same AWS account.\nWe can probably set the various repos to also allow the Crafting account's nodes to pull freely as well, but the issue still comes down to \"crafting containers don't authenticate to AWS as their node\" - or in other words a node can authenticate by virtue of its innate identity as defined by AWS, but the workloads therein have to somehow assume the same role as said node. Most tools that run locally will do so by default via the AWS API, but containers that are used as an individual's workspace are not going to do so. Instead, they have to be explicitly authenticated, lest we have blanket AuthN/AuthZ against the entire IB Dev account, which as I've mentioned is an anti-pattern that we'll be eliminating wherever possible.",
