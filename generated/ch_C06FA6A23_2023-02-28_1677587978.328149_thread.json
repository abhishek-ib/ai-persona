Do we have the gcp client package installed for us to import it in our UDFs?\nI have a use case in Colpal for this.\n\npackage: https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/\nSample snippet: https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/blob/main/samples/snippets/storage_fileio_write_read.py\n\nI get an import error on ib.com (http://ib.com) for this. The purpose is to read and write files from / to a gcp storage bucket.\nOur GCP drive mount option is beta. So in case it does not work, we need to fallback to the API approach.\n\ncc: @Biz @Krista Hardebeck @vartika.bhargava @Murali @Piyush @Sreenath Anilkumar",

Even if they upgrade the platform, they may oppose going to production with a beta feature\nThey are yet to comeback on the platform upgrade and using our bucket mounting option, however I just wanted to be ready with plan B in case it doesn't work out",
