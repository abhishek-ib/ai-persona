      "message": "Hey team, I'm testing a 24.07 release vulnerability ticket and I was wondering how I could use crafting to test this. Whenever I have this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/71331) branch checked out and run `cs <command>`, I get `Connection closed by remote host` and thus disconnected. I'm assuming 24.07 is missing the files that are present in master that configure these commands so I'm mostly wondering\n• do I need anything more than the `.sandbox` folder (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/tree/master/.sandbox) off master on my PR branch to get the `cs` commands working?\n• after that, is flipping the aihub env var flag all thats needed for getting enterprise up instead of aihub?",

      "message": "Hey @pauline.comising -- it depends:\n\n1. If you want the 1-click experience we are used to now: this requires backporting a lot of fixes I made for running various services in local mode to 24.07. Probably not possible.\n2. If you want to use Crafting as a Linux VM, and run `ppy` like the old days, then it's possible. It may be easier to use your laptop at that point though. It depends; the laptops are tricky to get working too :confused:\nI would start with (2) by trying good old `ppy compile lite && ppy start lite` to see if it works in the crafting sandbox. If the services boot, you're in luck.",
