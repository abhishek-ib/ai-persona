      "message": "ah I see the issue. We only include files if they are used in lookup fns (hardcoded in external_formula_files_reader.py). @Nithin one workaround for you right now is just to make a column that does a lookup in the csv file you want included in the binary. You can make the field a hidden field (prefix with underscore) so it doesn't show up in the output. In the meantime, @Felicia and @dlluncor can work to get that fix into the April release.",
