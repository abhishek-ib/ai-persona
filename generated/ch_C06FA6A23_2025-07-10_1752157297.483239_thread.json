I wanted to give everyone a heads up that we will remove it early next week.\n\nTo help folks out, here's a guide for common Bazel tasks and their native Go equivalents. I'll re-post this again next week too.\n\nBuild a package:\n```bazel build //shared-utils/go-utils/src/instabase/utils/... => \n\ngo build instabase/utils/...```\nRun a test:\n```bazel test //shared-utils/go-utils/src/instabase/utils/... => \n\ngo test instabase/utils/...```\nGenerate protos: (see https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/72184 for commentary)\n```(bazel generated these previously) => \n\ngo generate instabase/protos/...```\nGenerate mocks: (see https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/72184 for commentary)\n```(bazel or make command, depending on the package) => \n\ngo generate instabase/mocks/...```\nOther commands related to services (`make build-docker run-docker` etc) remain the same, but will be powered by `go build` instead of `bazel build`. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\nOther changes: If you have `GOPACKAGESDRIVER` set to the Bazel packages driver in your editor, remove that setting. It's not needed with the native Go builds. Hooray for being able to build and use the Go language server at the same time!!",
