      "message": "@Heymian can you confirm we don’t use any typeshed (https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main) stubs in our monorepo? My understand is that our mypy version is too old to properly support typeshed stubs that are in newer version.\n\nAsking this because I do see `types-stripe` is used to type check `stripe` package in `shared-utils/py-utils/billing-utils/src/py/instabase/billing_utils` . Don’t we need to create a new stub for stripe instead of using types-stripe? cc: @Victor Zeng",

If so, then things should be all good.",
