Updates can be found on the <#CGQ7BD72A|> channel. ~It’s likely this release won’t actually go to any customer, but mostly a checkpoint for our code before the holiday season.~",

We have automated considerable number of test in the flow land.. this will be more of a validation run to compare with the manual UAT.. if everything is good we can formally kick off the process from Jan release.. let me know if you want to look at the demo sometime.. @Ramesh is ready with the first set of automation!!",
