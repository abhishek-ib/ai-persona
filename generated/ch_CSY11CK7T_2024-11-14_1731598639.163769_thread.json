      "message": "Hey team, trying to get this sorted with JPMC still, we just got off of a long call with them about this and they are very resistant to upgrading now that they can see the vulnerability fixes in the patch notes, and are therefore aware of python package updates between versions. (i.e. they kept saying they’re okay to go to .39 because that’s before we started logging CVE fixes, so they can’t see the package updates)\n\nThey’re approaching a code freeze and are worried that these fixes could affect their solutions in ways that they do not expect, unless they can get a full promise from our team that they will be unaffected, which we’re obviously unable to give.\n\nThat leaves us with the unfortunate ask of how much effort it would be to backport the fix to the existing release-24.04.37-jpmc branch and certify the new nginx image for them as a one off, or if we should commit to them that we are fully unable to accommodate. Giving them just the individually updated .43 image that will be certified today seems overly risky.",
