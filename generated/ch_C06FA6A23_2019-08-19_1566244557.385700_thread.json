Note this will only send metering information to Azure.  None of your customer data needs to go to Azure. If you need a fully disconnected solution, we’d love to hear from you to learn more about your use case as we’re interested in helping with those projects as well.\n```\nSo there's a chance we might be able to work out a deal to do self report.
