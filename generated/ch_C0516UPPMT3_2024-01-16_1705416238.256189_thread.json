      "message": "Hello. I found AI Hub classification to be very sensitive to the class name we chose. Is there a way to edit the prompt it uses for classification, so we can have more control over it? It's also sensitive to the language used in the class name as well, working better for class names in English than in other languages. That's why it could be good to have some manual control over the classification prompt.",
