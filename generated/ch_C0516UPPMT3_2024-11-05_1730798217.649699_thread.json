But for a large list like 5000 exams in Fernando's case that would not fit into the context window of the cleaning prompt.\n@Jasper yeah I agree! This becomes a limitation in AIHub! This is possible in the enterprise version though through refiner where you can consume LLM in batches to perform this.\ncc: @avi @Kaustubh (KD) We can make these requirements possible if we bring build reasoning field under Agent FW. Copying @Rakesh as well, to explore/brainstorm this. This can enable sales/sol eng to bring in many useful tools but also in a controlled manner unlike the UDFs.",
