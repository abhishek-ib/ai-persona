      "message": "Hi team, I'm working with a long bank statement and trying to create one large table to extract all the info. A couple things here:\n1. It's extremely laggy to define list attributes. Towards the end of the video, you'll see me wave around the cursor for a solid 30 seconds before the text that I typed show up. There's ~1000 rows extracted so understand the volume is large, but I feel we should be handling these better.\n2. List extraction seems to be the best way to capture all entries across all pages, but it doesn't behave very consistently. From provenance, you can see that it extracts all of the information for most rows but not for others. Any other suggestions on how to accomplish this with the highest accuracy?",
