      "message": "after discussing with pauline after today's sync, i think for v0 we'd like to still make use of refiner execution for udf/derived fields and clean lines. we don't need a separate refiner step, and we can directly call refiner execution w/ gemini's response in order to simplify the executed flow. AIHub exclusively uses low code refiner instead of enterprise's legacy refiner, offering a lighter-weight, neat way of computing these fields, as is, through function calls, rather than using legacy refiner's syntax tree parser logic (see execute_low_code_function_call (http://execute_low_code_function_call) in FnExecutor). Ofc we can go a step further to not use refiner and refactor the necessary native function logic if we see that it's not efficient, but it is a bigger lift and i think this frees up time to make progress in the build changes that will require moving away from the individual tasks of classification and field-by-field extraction to something more one-shot.",
