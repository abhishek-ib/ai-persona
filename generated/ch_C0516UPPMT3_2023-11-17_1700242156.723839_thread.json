This is specified in our UI text guidelines (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/2104492033/UI+text+guidelines#Switches-(toggles),-toggle-chips,-and-single-checkboxes).\n\nWe should also consider grouping options by app, so we don't have to specify app name in the option. See recommendations below.\n\nI also have technical questions about existing options:\n1. What's up with the validations in Build option? Validations seem to work without enabling this toggle, so do we actually need it? And why is it grouped with UDFs in refinement?\n2. What is \"map-reduce extraction pipeline\"? We should be clearer about what this means.\n*Features*\n(o ) Dark mode\n\n*Converse* #subhead\n(o ) Multi-doc conversations\n\n*Build* #subhead\n(o ) Validations\n(o ) Custom functions in refinements\n(o ) Map-reduce extraction pipeline",
