      "message": "Cypress wrap from last week (Oct 21 - Oct 25th):\n\n• General issues:\n    ◦ Most cypress runs (CI and local) were entirely timing out due to socket issue in the middle of the tests that was unrelated to any frontend or backend changes we had made: `This socket has been ended by the other party`\n        ▪︎ @Paul H eventually fixed this by *1) updating cypress to a newer version that reportedly fixed this issue* and *2) removing webpack's websocket server that we were not using anyways* (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1729632684647409)\n            • It seemed like 2) actually fixed the issue but 1) is a still a good idea to check for when we see an issue on the cypress side, there may be a newer version that could fix it!\n    ◦ The review-dashboard tests were failing after a new feature became opt-out and the cypress tests were not edited before that happened. We have seen this before when features switch their release state too.\n        ▪︎ @Xindi Xu came to the rescue by changing our cypress action to now run all tests whenever a feature flag changes (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1729710742688219?thread_ts=1729702997.666769&cid=CSY11CK7T)\n            • Please fetch and rebase your PRs if something related to this is broken for anyone\n• Fixes\n    ◦ Big props to Paul and Xindi for making big fixes that helped everyone's runs be more stable and for future changes that will have a big upside!\n    ◦ I increased the timeout in the `edit-account` test for the delete-user request because it was always taking longer. The test started passing after that and Xindi has put up a PR that should make the endpoint faster as well\n• Current state\n    ◦ Cypress is mainly red on master because of non-blocking tests we have in CI and flaky tests otherwise. As a result, I don't think it is a bad as it seems, but we need to crack down on the non-blocking tests. Some of these are now passing often so we can probably make them blocking!\n*List of non-blocking tests and their owners to make them blocking or fix them!*\n• aihub-derived-field -- @danny.lan \n• aihub-refinement-udf -- @danny.lan \n• aihub-custom-function-field -- @danny.lan \n• search-app -- @Subash \n• deployment-api-instructions -- @Jessica\n• deployment-notifications (new) -- @Jessica \n• service-accounts-crud -- @Xindi Xu?
