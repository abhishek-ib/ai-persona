I've seen times where wrong values would tend to have confidences in the low end of 95.x% and correct values would start having confidences in the high end of 95.x%.\n\nEven with LLMs, I've seen very specific prompts bring up the overall confidence levels, and even wrong values had confidences in the high 9x.x%s.  Though, that project's accuracy requirements weren't as strict, so we didn't need to analyze a lot of results and draw a fine line on the confidence validation.  I can see a need for other Build projects to get more precise.",
