      "message": "I am currently speaking with all of our SaaS customers to learn about their experience and collect feedback on anything, ranging from SaaS to IB platform and more. Cass is the first in the series of customers. I will be sending out notes after speaking with each customer, and a summary of all customers afterwards.\n\n*Note -* This is the same as the email that was sent out today, but for people who prefer Slack over Email :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nCass was very responsive and open, and provided a lot of feedback. Their feedback over 1 hour covered a few major areas: SaaS & upgrades, solution migration, and general permissions.\nIn attendance: 8+ people from Cass, spanning multiple business units and responsibilities, e.g.\n• People in charge of developers and operators\n• People who used to work on managing their on-prem\n• Data Science/people who are hands-on with model training\n*TL;DR* Happy with SaaS. Instabase support is very responsive and helpful. Model training seems slower than their on prem, solution migration is very manual, and would like permissions on the platform can be more granular. Needs more push to learn about / use ICC - upcoming secrets feature will solve some pain points.\n\nFull notes doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3PAoNWz29_4bug811NW7rMsvAURkl7S2EuB_Chq1QM/edit",
