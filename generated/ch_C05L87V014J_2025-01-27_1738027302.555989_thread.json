Right now, for my sandbox (https://instabase.sandboxes.site/sandboxes/sayanbhattacharjee1?cw=dev), I see server-nginx and control-pane are both red in either Probes or Processes. For server-nginx it seems the error relates to using an old version of node (12.3, when we need >= 14?). However, i'm not sure how i can fix it commands online weren't very helpful (tried the command in the :thread:)",
