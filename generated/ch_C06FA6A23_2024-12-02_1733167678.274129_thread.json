      "message": "Hi team,\nI am excited to kick off a series of sessions aiming to share tribal knowledge among us. As our engineering team has grown and as we build the Instabase platform, it is evident that a lot of us have little knowledge about areas we don’t directly work in. These sessions will aim to alleviate the problem a bit by introducing everyone to the basics of the different parts of the platform, product and infrastructure, the operational knowledge needed to provide urgent support during times when the subject matter expert is unavailable and serve as resources we can refer to when helping new engineers ramp up.\nWe will start the series on Monday, Dec 9, where @mfichman will share updates on the latest state of Crafting sandboxes and a guide on how to use a template he’s been working on.\n\nSome notes about the sessions:\n1. The schedule for the sessions will be maintained here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2656337921/Schedule+and+Recordings) (go/tribal). Please add topics you’d like to know about and/or vote for existing topics in the Wishlist (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2656403462/Wishlist).\n2. *Please sign up*: Eng managers will encourage their teams to sign up for sessions as well but if you would like to sign up, please ping me directly.\n3. All sessions will be recorded but please try to attend these sessions live, if possible\n4. The schedule of sessions will be confirmed two weeks in advance. Please try to make sure we don’t have to reschedule.\n5. There is no fixed format for the sessions. Feel free to follow a format that best suits the topic. Assume that nobody knows anything and avoid going into extreme detail.\n6. If possible, please add content about general operational guidance - most common issues, steps to monitor, debug and fix them etc.\n7. Please leave at least 15 mins at the end for Q/A\nLet me know if you don’t get a calendar invite in the next hour.",
