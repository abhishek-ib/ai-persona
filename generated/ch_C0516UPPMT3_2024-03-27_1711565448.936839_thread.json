      "message": "When extracting tables I am seeing a few scenarios.  In the attached payslip there is a natural Earnings Table and a Deductions Table.  Form Recognizer is showing them as a single table most likely due to the single set of headers in particular \"this period\" and \"year to date\" being shared headers for both tables.  When asking for the Earnings table using the table data type and a basic prompt I get the expected result.  When asking for the deductions table I get a \"table not found\" response.  I expect that response is due to Form Recognizer identifying an Earnings table and not a separate Deductions table.",
