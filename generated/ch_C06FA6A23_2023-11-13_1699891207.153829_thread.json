I was doing some looking, and there are a couple automated tools that seem to do the job but may require some code annotations.  I will get back to doing some more research.  There is a service now with SwaggarHUB that does OpenAPI spec publishing that could even be made available to our clients.  Need to check with @jean to see if we already have sufficient capability in our own API docs to just add a Swaggar/OpenAPI spec section/link if we can automate in our build process.",
