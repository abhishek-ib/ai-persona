And, we’ll put up a nightly job to delete inactive sandboxes by end of week.\n\nYou can look at how long your sandboxes have been hibernated by visiting: https://admiral.instabase.com/sandbox\n\nIf you can actively go and delete the sandboxes that are not being used, it will be super helpful to actively reduce our costs.",
