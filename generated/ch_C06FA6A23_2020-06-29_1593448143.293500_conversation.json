      "message": "<!channel> Our Golden Tests have not passed in the last 7 weeks, which is why we are  planning to make the short week a ‘Golden Tests Fixit’ week.   It is important for us to have these tests passing to make sure that the changes made to our system are working as expected.  In the past, the Golden Tests have caught errors before the Release are cut.\n\nIn order to ensure that we are focusing completely on this, we are:\n• Going to block the release cut if Golden Tests don’t pass\n• Requesting people to prioritize the fixes to Golden Tests if and when we discover the issues\nThe success criteria for the fixit would be to have Golden Tests passing consistently for 1 day.\n\nPlease join the channel <#C0161B1M57Y|> to follow the updates.",
