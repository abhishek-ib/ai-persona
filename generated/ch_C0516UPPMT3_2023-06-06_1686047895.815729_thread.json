The quality of the answer is a function of three factors:\n1. quality of input prompt \n2. selection of right chunks to pass as context \n3. output generated by the model \nThe difference between performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 comes mainly from step 3. Our strategy, especially for long docs in Converse app, is the same otherwise. e.g. we haven’t been using longer context window while using GPT-4.\n\n@Hari @Rafal @vineeth to confirm.",
