      "message": "hi team, trying to be a bit more transparent about week-to-week interviewing progress now that we've turned the faucet back on with hiring. so will try to send these regular weekly updates to discuss leading indicators and bottlenecks that we are aiming to improve.\n\nwe have 3 open roles for the Automate team -- Backend, Frontend, and Fullstack\n\nover the last week, we've processed about 1000 resumes across those roles. this has led to ~20 candidates moving into the first technical phone screen.\n\nwe conducted 10 technical phone screens this week with a 30% pass through rate. this puts us at the lower end of the industry average around 30-50% with most startups around our size landing around 35%.\n\nbased on a couple \"Definitely Not\" ratings, @Serena and I have adjusted our resume screening process to hopefully reduce the number of these types of interview results moving forward.\n\nthanks! please give feedback on if this is useful or not and if there are additional metrics that you all would love to see in future weeks :thank_you::one-sec-cooking:",
