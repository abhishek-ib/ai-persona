I don’t think there’s much else to understand. \n\n@wadams , for your call tomorrow I think you don’t need to include engineers. What will be useful to know is\nWhat’s “real-time” requirement for them (like how much time they require the data to return) \nWhat’s the document they want to process, on average how many pages are in a doc, do the docs need OCR\nWhat’s the data they want to extract from a document \n\nBasically what’s the input and output for their use case, and what’s the time requirement",
