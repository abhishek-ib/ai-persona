Might be stable again after current deploy, but I'm not confident.\n• 23.10 is timing out on deploy as well, though I haven't confirmed why just yet.\n• 23.01 is broken on `celery-core-tasks` due to a failing import (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CCY413CSU/p1712333723498189)\n• 23.07 hasn't worked for days, most recently because it spins for an hour on ??? (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CCY413CSU/p1712324958793839) and then fails with a 404.\nBlasting here because I don't have a great feel for who owns what or who should be contacted when and where. Donagh and Arkadiusz have jumped in on 24.01 and maybe 23.10 if it's the same failure case, but the others... :man-shrugging::skin-tone-3:",
