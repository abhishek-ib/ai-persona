Can you rebase your PR branches and see if it reverts any re-formatting that was happening? It doesn't fix everything unfortunately, but should revert a lot of the changes.\n\nAlso let me know if you don't see the flags being applied. I set the flags only in .style.yapf and removed them from .pre-commit-config.yaml. It worked fine for me but @Heymian said her precommit wasn't picking up the config.",
