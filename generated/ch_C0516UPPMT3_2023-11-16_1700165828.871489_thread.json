Looks like it hasn't changed much in the design - is that intentional?\n• What's rationale for using \"Home\" vs. \"My Hub\" as the back button?",

Note that we don't have the avatar on uat because I added the avatar separately based on design changes and didn't backport it because it was too late.\nit'd be great to have a design for the collapsed state.\nNot sure about the + sign tho. I think we should let the user know which workspace they are creating the project in so it's good to only allow users to create projects when the context switcher is available (when nav is expanded)",

Here's a list of inconsistencies/updates made (edited based on the latest image by Xindi):\n• chevron should align with '+'\n• ~avatar is missing, we should add this for consistency~ (@Xindi Xu saw your comment)\n• implementation doesn't match spacing and text sizes for the org + ws selector\n• ~All the content (icons and text) should align on the left in the side nav~\n• TJ has reviewed the grays, my understanding is that 'projects' is gray because it is the header; @tj.serkes can you confirm?\n    ◦ @tj.serkes when you get a chance, can you also address Aayush's comment here (https://www.figma.com/file/lLzD56xkVyZozgDu3dFjc1?node-id=3954:105606&mode=design#618753992)?\n• Agree with Hannah that we should use 'projects' and not 'my projects' since user could select a shared ws\n• @hannah if i recall correctly, the intent of keeping 'home' was to rewire the concept of home, i.e. that users will now be redirected to the projects page inside their selected ws in my hub to view all their projects where they would have search, filters, and sorting to manage all their projects better. Only reason to have 'my hub' is to reduce confusion because of previous behavior (if we have a lot of existing users), and then switch back to 'home' at a later point to ease users in.",
