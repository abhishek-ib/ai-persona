      "message": "Everyone - We have decided to push back the internal launch of AI hub by two weeks to *May 15th.* We are going to use the time to polish existing user journeys, and finish work on remaining user journeys (e.g. usage based billing, loginless experience with rate limits).\n\nI know that all of you are eagerly awaiting to test out the new experience, and share your feedback. Thanks for your patience, give us a bit more time to craft a great experience we all can be proud of.\n\nPlease donâ€™t try out the aihub.dev (http://aihub.dev) environment meanwhile. It is going to have frequent deployments over the next two weeks, and not meant for user testing and feedback. We will release the internal preview on a separate staging environment. You can continue using the AI Labs GTM sandbox for testing and demos.\n\nIf there are any questions, let us know.\n\ncc: @Ashish @Kerry @shaunak",
