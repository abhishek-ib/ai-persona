I think this may be a scenario where a subset of information included in Search is holding us back -- i'm noticing the preferred asset you shared doesn't appear to be in the shared HR drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALQghXdTXq8GUk9PVA) that we have included in Search (although @Cecelia, I am curious if it should be!).\n\nHowever, I don't know that we have optimized for timestamp / recency of docs, so I wouldn't be surprised if we have an opportunity on retrieval side as well. But @vineeth / @Hari I am curious if there have been any discussions around that!",
