      "message": "Hi team- if a tabular field is referenced in a Derived field and the Derived field tries to return a non-tabular response an error is returned: `The cleaning prompt resulted in a non-tabular response which is not currently supported.` If I adjust the Derived prompt to return a tabular object I will get back a tabular response. It's unclear if this is a bug or if it's a design where if you reference a tabular field the Derived field must also return a tabular object.",
