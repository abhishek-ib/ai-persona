      "message": ":alarm: Hi all! Heads-up that we hit a tag limit in our `instabase-dev/stats-adapter`  ECR image repo, and as such I’ve dropped all but the actual currently-certified release tag from it. If you have a sandbox that is still live, you may find that `stats-adapter` sidecar images can’t pull right now, and you’ll need to re-run your sandbox pipeline(s) from the affected branches to get it back.\n\nThis is not a permanent fix, and may be needed again, but we’ll get a fix rolling when we identify it.\n\nThanks!",
