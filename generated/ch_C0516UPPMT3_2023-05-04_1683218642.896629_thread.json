Try to be as brief as possible.” which works fine with chatgpt, but with aihub I have to ask for a list with each question. Is there a way to ask once and have all answers be a list?",

Here’s another example where this might be useful.\n\nImagine a chat conversation like ‘tell me the top 3 priorities’ then later asking ‘what are the plans to achieve priority 3’.
