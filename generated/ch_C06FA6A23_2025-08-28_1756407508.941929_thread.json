Ask your manager for force merge if you believe the failure is not related to your PR.\n\nThis CI test things end-to-end:\n1. creating a sandbox\n2. building services based on the code changes in the PR\n3. seed DB\n4. run Cypress tests in the sandbox\nThis is flaky in nature, because test coverage it high.\n\nTo delete your sandbox: go to https://instabase.sandboxes.site/sandboxes, search \"pr-<pr number>\" , and then delete it",

It also fails within <1 min so i usually wait couple sec after opening a PR then retry - usually once it runs for a while it succeeds~ Still we should investigate why it fails but just a thing i noticed.",

We can also disable merge-blocking if this becomes an issue.\n\nHere are some stats: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMNujB2fqxp9P1KvEBRnoG1lV-JcjMaFnvvgdNePob0/edit?usp=sharing\nOld Cypress CI average failure rate over the months ranges from 4% to 65%.\nNew Cypress CI average failure rate for August is around 35%.\n\nThe formula to calculate average failure rate is: `SUM (failure rate of make-sandbox + MAX (failure rate of Cypress 1,2,3))`\n\nStill high, but it's better than before.\nThe new Cypress CI fails fast. The high failure rate comes from the make-sandbox step. If it fails, it usually fails within a couple of minutes. The average run time of the make-sandbox step is 10.64 minutes.\nThe old Cypress CI fails slow. The high failure rate comes from the actual Cypress test run. If it fails, it takes around an hour.",
