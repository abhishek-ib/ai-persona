From the perspective of all types of in-scope user roles navigating the application, approximately how many dynamic pages in total are there? *Users interact with approximately 20 distinct single-page apps (\"dynamic pages\") that generally correspond to the list of \"All Apps\" within the Instabase app (e.g. Classifier, Flow, Marketplace)*\n2. If such web services or remoting endpoints are exposed, how many methods / operations are there? *Instabase apps do not expose underlying web services outside of the app environment, which is controlled by the customer.*\n3. For such web services, can documentation or test harnesses detailing how to create well-formed requests be provided? *N/A given that these endpoints are not exposed*\n4. On what technologies / programming languages is the application built? (ASP, ASP.NET (http://ASP.NET), J2EE, C/C++, etc) *Java, Python, Go, Typescript*\n5. Does the application utilise 3rd party frameworks or APIs? (Dojo, Spring, GWT, etc) *React, Flask, Redis, RabbitMQ, Celery, gRPC, Thrift*",

For the first question they want to know how many pages there are roughly on the application to give them an idea on how long it will take to test each section/page. 1-50, 1-100, 100+ is the kind of answer they expect â€“ an idea on size. For the last question they are happy with our answer for now and will reach out if they need anything more.",
