      "message": "*PSA on Sandboxes*:\nPlease start creating sandboxes in AWS instead of Azure when possible.  We are consolidating our cloud usage AWS to get better prices on compute and to simplify our development cycles for new sandbox features.  Instructions for creating sandboxes on AWS are here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1213497394/AWS+Create+an+IB+Sandbox).  We will continue to support and actively develop the Azure deployment pipelines, as there are some cases where it will still be necessary to deploy on Azure.  AWS Quota has recently been increased so the recent quota issues seen during deployments should be fixed.\n\nPlease reach out to myself or @Shubham Oli with any questions/issues.",
