Questions using Find/Calculate to retrieve data based on a specific month is not working. (Find ticket count that were created in May OR Calculate the tickets requested in June). The response attached below is little confusing. It works only when question is “Find ticket count that were created between the 01-June to 30-June”. Is this an expected behaviour or any better way of achieving it?",
