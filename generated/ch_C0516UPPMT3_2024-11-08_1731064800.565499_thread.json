      "message": "Hey team, we are currently running a POV with CVS where they are building themselves. The team is made up of data scientists and experienced IDP developers. Overall, they said they've been \"super impressed\" so far :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nAfter 1 week of trial, they have compiled a list of issues + product suggestions that I've attached (I also have the associated files for testing if required). Below I've also summarised the main requests + observations from their team:\n1. Some issues with checkbox performance - particularly ones that are in a table-like structure.\n    a.  I suspect visual models + Form-like improvements might help here?\n2. Provenance missing or inconsistency (this came up multiple times)\n    a. Similar to @Clemens point here (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0516UPPMT3/p1731034332868019)\n    b. Even if the answer is correct, this decreases trust in the product\n3. Provenance auto-scrolling - they have seen inconsistency here. Mainly working for text extraction but not other field types\n    a. I have seen this a lot also, but appears inconsistent about when you get dragged to the page or not\n    b. Can we add markers to the doc for instances where provenance blocks are across multiple pages? In those cases I think you get dragged to the first (of possibly many) bounding boxes\n4. They have some cases where pieces of information can be found in multiple places of the document. They see that often the model picks up one instance, but doesn't tell you if there is conflicting information elsewhere\n    a. This may be a prompting problem e.g. list extraction\n    b. Or could be that this shows up in low confidence scores?\ncc @jordy.vlan @Sławek Biel @Kaustubh (KD)",

I'll give a try soon using visual models cc: @Rakesh . 2 is understood, I think we need to move past the naive approach that we have today, curious to see the hackathon work by @jordy.vlan but will set up some thing for next week to brainstorm approaches. 4. I think our approach at the system level is to given only response I don't think we are \"set up\" to even look for other answers but @lydia can better answer this.",
