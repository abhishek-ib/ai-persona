      "message": "1) Is there a ticket open to allow projects to be copyable during read-only mode?\n\nExample - we had a few folks open a Build project today to copy into their own space to make edits - unfortunately they had to do it one at a time because one person would take the write mode which prevents copying\n\n2) Are there any plans to be able to set user permissions to read-only for a workspace? This would help with the above too where we only want a user to access projects to read information/copy the project into their personal workspace",
