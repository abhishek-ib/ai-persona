      "message": "Hi team, if I should be asking this somewhere else, please let me know and I will x-post. Nationwide is asking if it’s possible for us to enable enforced mTLS encryption for all api calls that they make to our system. They are in a single-tenant AIHub environment, so this wouldn’t interfere with other tenants, but it’s obviously not something that we support at present. Is this something we can roadmap, or something that we have already roadmapped? I think the issue is rather complex as our internal applications use the same api endpoints as external calls use :disappointed:  cc @Alex Sgueglia @Atul Grover",

Depending on how the reverse proxy is working that may be sufficient. Patching nginx-conf is also really not stable still also, when it comes to issues caused by upgrades, so we'd need to figure that out as well",
