      "message": "Cross-posting this! Excited to announce that we now support post-paid billing for community users. This means that community customers can now input credit card details and be billed at the end of the month for their usage. This implementation also migrates all community billing from license service to metronome - finally unifying our AI Hub commercial, enterprise and community billing into a single place.\n\nAlso note, all future license adjustments for community user licenses must happen through metronome. You will no longer be able to adjust through the platform directly.\n\nAs always, please share feedback! Huge thanks to @Victor Zeng @Weiming Wu @Siya @Rosie!",
