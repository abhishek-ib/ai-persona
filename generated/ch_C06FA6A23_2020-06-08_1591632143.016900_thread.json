First line coordinate matching with 3rd an 4th line of the OCR text.\n \nSuppose I have image in right rotation, I run through the OCR and capture the OCR text and OCR locations of each word.\nSame image I rotated by 180 degree, I run through the OCR and capture the OCR and OCR location. Ideally coordinates of the OCR text word should be same which I got it from step #1 but currently same is not same\n \nI have same issue with HQ an MARX both.```\nBasically, if they rotate the image themselves ahead of time, they aren’t getting the same coordinates than if they do it using us.",

Is that correct?\n\nIf so, I believe it is happening because we trim whitespace on rotated images, as well as using a slightly different algorithm to adjust the coordinates. However, the *relative* coordinates of all the words should be identical, though not the absolute coordinates.\n\nIf that approach doesn't work for your use case, please let me know what that use case is, and we will see what we can do to help.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid```",
