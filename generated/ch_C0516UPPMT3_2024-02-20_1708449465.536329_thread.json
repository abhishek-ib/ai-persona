      "message": "Hi All - quick thing on split classify I have noticed. When it is used for packets that are long (80+ pages), the system seems to freeze a lot whenever it is trying to split up. Once it is trying to split up and freezes, we have the option to either force quit and wait for the project to timeout, or wait for the system to catch up. For example - I put 1 loan packet in this project (typically id assume clients use more than 1 to test/prompt). I added all the doctypes to the right, then hit classify - after this, the system spent 12ish minutes classifying the single packet. When i tried to exit out and rejoin the project, the operation was still happening and I had to wait for it to lag out. Any ideas on how to reduce the lag on training/interacting with docs post classification step? Every time you need to backout, the doc needs to reclassify",
