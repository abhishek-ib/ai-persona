I promptly forgot about this and kept doing what I was doing, and then 2 hours later everything on my machine shut down without warning while I was in the middle of working. luckily I didn't really lose anything important, but wondering if there's a way to schedule this to not happen in the middle of the day or allow me to delay the update? my own fault for ignoring the warning earlier in the day, but still a bit of an inconvenience to have to wait for an OS upgrade in the middle of the workday :slightly_smiling_face:",
