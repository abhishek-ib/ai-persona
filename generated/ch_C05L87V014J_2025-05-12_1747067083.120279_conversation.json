With the recent cleanup of a few accounts in the instabase-dev openai account, we started getting reports of the openai key used within our crafting environments not working anymore with errors like `You do not have access to the organization tied to the API key.`. I've updated the openai_api_key secret with a new key generated from the itadmin service account, please resync your sandboxes to allow the secret to get updated within your sandboxes!\n\nThanks @arun @Peelo for helping in getting the key generated! :raised_hands::skin-tone-2:",
