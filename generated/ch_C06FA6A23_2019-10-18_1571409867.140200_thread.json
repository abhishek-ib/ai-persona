      "message": "but i think it’s not just the “apply refiner IBOCR”. it’s “the IBOCR so far” — and it’s very reasonable to think users would download the output of the last step thinking it’s a summary, then come across the same problem I did. And the field still has useful data (raw OCR)— why overwrite it with a `.value()` dump of refined_phrases?\n\nAre you good with changing this behavior and keeping the text field the same @dlluncor ? we can check with Hari/Sudeep to see if SC uses the text field once it’s been changed in this way (they’d be the only candidate and even then, unlikely).",
