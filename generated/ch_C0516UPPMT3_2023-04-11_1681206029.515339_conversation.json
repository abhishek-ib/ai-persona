What would our proposed integration of AI Hub Chat look like for a customer?\n> By mounting onto existing filesystems, could such conversational / search interactions be run across a large library of documents? What would the output look like, both as text and being able to filter documents?\n> What scale to be realistically aware of (thousands of S3 buckets, millions of documents, each with hundreds of pages etc.)? \n> What about the # of users with Chat access and concurrency of prompts?",
