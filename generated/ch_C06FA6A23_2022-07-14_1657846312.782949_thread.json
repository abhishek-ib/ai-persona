It is our incoming always active VPN technology that will longer term become our required method for accessing company resources.\n\nWe have begun rolling out the tool to newer hires on our Kandji MDM tool and weâ€™ll begin to onboard more to the system as be begin to migrate longer term IBers over next week.\n\nAs the tool is there to filter traffic and provide firewall and security protection we are hoping to collaborate with any groups that run into issues and get our allowlists modified so we are not limiting any productivity. While we are not stopping anyone from turning off the connectivity when needed at this point, we do want to work to make sure the VPN can become a true always on tool.",
