The release coordinator docs were updated during the rewrite to indicate that certifying  the \"newly-cut\" aihub release branch doesn't happen until the week _after_ code-cut, so that's already handled (for instance, 25.12.0-aihub isn't being certified for the first time until tomorrow)\n\nI won't make the schedule change this week as we've not announced it, and it will affect UAT completion pushes, but feel free to announce the new UAT cut-off broadly and loudly and we can change the cron schedule after tomorrow's builds. :+1:",
