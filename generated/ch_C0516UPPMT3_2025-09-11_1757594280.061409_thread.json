If it’s working for reviewers, it should also work for testers, since testers have all the permissions that reviewers do.\nLet me set up a call so we can look into this together",

Initially, I assumed the issue was only affecting tester roles, but it seems to impact reviewers, review managers, and testers as well (I’ll update this in the ticket).\nIt is working on AIHub MT, so the problem could be user-related. We had a similar issue (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1751893957814659) earlier where a single user’s project configuration caused the entire group to lose access to the workspace.\nI’ll connect with Suleiman to investigate this further.",
