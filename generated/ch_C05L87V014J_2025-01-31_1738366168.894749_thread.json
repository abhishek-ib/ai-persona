      "message": "Hey team, I'm trying to build some proto objects (specifically in `repo_service.proto`) by running the following 2 commands (`cd ~/instabase/webserver/api-server && poetry run make build-protos`) but I have some errors along the way. Here's the error I saw and how I fixed it:\n```The currently activated Python version 3.7.3 is not supported by the project (3.9.17).```\n1. `poetry env list` returned nothing\n2. Installed poetry using this: `python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Poetry`\n3. Then I needed to install python3.9.17 (couldn't work with 3.9 only) with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install software-properties-common && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt install python3.9 && pyenv install 3.9.17 && pyenv local 3.9.17` . Likely all the commands weren't needed (probably just needed the last 3 or 4?) but otherwise it didn't quite work\n4. Set poetry to use that python version: `poetry env use $(pyenv which python)`\n*Finally it worked after!*",
