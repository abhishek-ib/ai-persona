      "message": "^^ Hi all!\n\nWanted to correct a mistake I made during my talk on Crafting last week. I forgot to mention all the work that @sean.donohoe put into initially pioneering Crafting at Instabase!\n\nSean implemented the first set of Crafting templates that our team has been using for the past year for frontend dev, backend dev, and pre-merge Cypress tests. The decision to use Crafting, driven by Sean, was a huge step forward that enabled the work I did over the past few weeks to improve the backend Crafting template. Sean also gave me a ton of guidance and help as I worked on this project. None of the work I did would have been possible without Sean's work.\n\nAlso, a huge shout out to @Cody Boggs, who gave a lot of guidance re: handling of Docker image caching, Crafting, and various other things that made the template easier to use.",
