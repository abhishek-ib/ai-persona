      "message": "Hi all, I have an observation on accuracy testing & definitions in AI Hub. I see the formula for validated accuracy is *# of automated and correct fields / all fields*.\n\nThis is different from how we've traditionally defined validated accuracy with customers during POVs and solution builds. We've taken the approach of *# of automated and correct fields / total automated fields.* Unless we've changed our approach with scoring POVs, this may be confusing to prospects/customers FYI @Jasper.\n\nAdditionally, validated accuracy as it's defined in AI Hub (*# of automated and correct fields / all fields*) seems more like an STP metric rather than a pure accuracy metric. It's a measure of the % of fields that are automatically processed correctly.",
