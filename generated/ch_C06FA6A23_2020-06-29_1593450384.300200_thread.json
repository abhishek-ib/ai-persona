      "message": "Hi there :wave: I'm looking for some direction on the latest with Split Classifier. A few questions I have are:\n• Can it be used in a metaflow? \n• Have we made any improvements to the set up/training of templates to make it easier for customers to set up?\n• Is there anyway to use the variable length split classification without a custom classifier? \nTagging those who I know have worked on it before, let me know if there is someone else to ask. cc: @Jesika Haria @arun @Jonathan Shih @lydia",

      "message": "An initial pass at the answers, eng please feel free to verify/modify:\n• It cannot be used in a Metaflow today due to Flow limitations. Instead, you have to run it with the Apply Classifier step.\n• Currently, we have been focusing on algorithm accuracy to prove initial usefulness. We are in the product reqs gathering phase to make classifiers easier to train (let’s chat if you have use cases in mind!), keeping in mind that the intended user is still technical. \n• I think @arun is working on precisely this for the July release (please chime in here!)",

      "message": "Yep so right now, if you want to do split classification on variable length document types your options are: use the \"Split by first-page\" classifier or use a custom classifier. The \"split by first-page\" approach works best for documents with consistent first pages like statements, or having cover pages. I'm atm working on a better classifier for just generally splitting documents, without the user needing to pick \"the right one\"",
