      "message": "@Hamish when I spoke to RAI yesterday they said they had responded to an RFP about a year ago and they didn’t select any vendor in this space as they wanted access to the models to train with their own data and at the time wasn’t available. (It’s in the roadmap now) but they didn’t choose any vendor but went in house.\n\nIt seems like they are more open to buy be build now. In terms of use cases, did they specify what use cases are interested in? KYC and Lending are probably the obvious ones",

      "message": "In terms of approaches and requirements, here are my thoughts:\n1. (Optimal approach) Use upstream integration to call RAI APIs and surface results in IB HR screen\n    a. Required: access document name in validation functions\n    b. Required: access document binaries in upstream integration custom function\n    c. Preferred: custom functions as an upstream integration\n    d. Preferred: allow multiple upstream integrations to be chained e.g. document passes from: storage facility -> RAI call -> IB app\n    e. Preferred: allow storage of secrets e.g. API keys, so these aren't visible in the custom function code\n2. (Workaround outside of IB) Use external script to call RAI and feed some docs into IB via API, depending on fraud result\n    a. No outstanding requirements",
