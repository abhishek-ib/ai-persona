To help save time, let's invest a few minutes now to update this list of technical owners (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zim7M_V_KlWRkOhRsjCdqR16EXxlFyxfq53k6ykUwnk/edit) for our apps and APIs. Please and thank you. Our PMs probably know most of the technical owners @John Hung @Justin @mimi",
