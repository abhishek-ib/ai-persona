Before we share it, we should fix a small number of critical issues:\n*(1) Rename model names - donâ€™t expose model names to user use standard and advanced (even in APIs) @Weiming Wu* *@Abhishek Adupa* \n(2) Accuracy/ ground truth - PR ready  @Weiming Wu\n(3) F99e1786-c407-4acb-9b4c-7d8f06cfd4ab app link (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/hub/apps/ae4f013c-4d98-44f4-97d4-01e8ed66fe7f/runs)  `All records had a runtime exception, last error observed: Failed to get classifier json: Path does not exist in zip: project/flows/modules/classifier_mod.classifier/classifier.ibclassifier`  @ayesha.ali\n(4) Bonus if we can support the 4 file formats (doc, docx, etc) that generate PDF in process files\n\n1 is blocker. Rest are good to merge. Once we have these, I can update on the channel that the internal preview is live! :slightly_smiling_face:",
