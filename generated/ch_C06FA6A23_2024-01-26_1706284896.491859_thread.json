      "message": "Loved this \"top learning\" from Jeetu Patel, GM and EVP of collaboration security at Cisco:\n\n> *Learning #4: “Design really f***ing matters”*\n> \n> For the longest time in business, I heard people say that sweating the details in design had diminishing returns beyond a point. Then Apple became one of the most valuable companies on the planet. And the myth of design beyond a point having diminishing returns was completely busted. It was proven that design drives business results.\n> \n> Here are 5 reasons why good design really matters:\n> \n> 1) Good design evokes positive emotion and delight. It creates loyalty.\n> \n> 2) Good design is a sign of respect and shows people you care. It shows people that you’re willing to take time to sweat the details, even the details that no one would notice. It shows pride in your work\n> \n> 3) Good design shows clear thinking\n> \n> 4) Good design is the ultimate sign of quality and excellence\n> \n> 5) Good design is good for business\n> \n> *Relentlessly pursue good design.*",
