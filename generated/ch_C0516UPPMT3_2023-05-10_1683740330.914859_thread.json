      "message": "Love the toggle for GPT4, that solves some challenges I had. May I suggest that when the toggle is on GPT4 that also attaches the conversation history, just like it does on chatgpt.\n\nI have 2 use cases where this came up:\n• ‘answer all questions in the form of a list, be as concise as possible’\n• On complex docs I’ve found myself following a question funnel like approach. like discovering facts then trying to perform analysis. My original prompts made reference to facts discovered in earlier prompts and that approach just didn’t work. I’ll try this again with GPT4 and see if gpt4 is smart enough to figure things out, I suspect it might, but it may have better accuracy with the chat history.\nLove the rapid progress I see day-to-day!",
