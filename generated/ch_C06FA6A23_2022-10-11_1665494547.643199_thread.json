      "message": "Good morning team :slightly_smiling_face: Despite pulling master a handful of times after the monaco PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/31370)'s been merged and recompiling my services, I'm still getting a localhost `monaco is not defined` error after logging in, and I'm unable to try and jump to other urls for local testing.\nI've recompiled all services included in `ppy compile lite` locally, as docker using prebuilt, and as docker without prebuilt. I've also made sure to `make build-local` in `webserver/shared/src/js/webpacked` and use the `RELOAD=true` flag for webapp, apps-server, and server-nginx, yet I can't seem to get rid of the monaco bug. All services included in `ppy status lite` are up, and on the frontend side, I've only found `celery-webdriver-tasks` to be down, but I'm getting dependency errors trying to download necessary imports to compile this service. Does anyone know what else I should try?",
