This seems to be intentional in the redesigned navbar because the add button has shifted down?\n\nThis is a bug for the old converse navbar on prod  - it shouldn't hide the icon when `enable_build_latest` is false. Will create a fix.",

This didn't occur in build in prod because it uses the duplicated `build_23_07` directory with the old navbar code.\n\nCreated the fix here: https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/46937",
