      "message": "Hey Engineering, as mentioned in the lightning talk during the EPD Offsite in Florida, *IT is aiming to have users _fully_ migrated to using Okta SSO to access AWS in lieu of local IAM Users / access keys by Friday April 7th.* \n\nIt is important to note that the new SSO roles are not tied with your old IAM user, and this will impact both your console and CLI access, so please start leveraging Okta SSO access for AWS as soon as you’re able so we can help you iron out any issues before the deadline. I’ve put together a Guidelines and FAQ doc here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/1988657155/AWS+SSO+Guidelines+and+FAQ) for your review, and any access requests can be submitted to <mailto:ithelp@instabase.com|ithelp@instabase.com>.\n\nAdditionally, if you know you are done with your old IAM accounts and ready to delete them, please let us know so we can clean up your account early and help reduce some of the crush around April 7th. Thanks!",

Each day you'd just need to run `aws sso login --sso-session <my-sso>` which will auto-redirect to your web browser for authentication.",
