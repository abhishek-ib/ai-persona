      "message": "agree LLMs are not that good at math, but it seems to be very simple math so this error is somehow surprising\n\nOne thing which might cause this is the tendency of the LLMs to justify their own output (generated before), so if the model generated the mistake it might make it more probable to generate a ridiculous statement to justify it (7789>8000)\n\nI think a prompt like\n```Generate a list of transaction values together with a boolean value indicating if the value is larger than 8000. Use format [{\"value\": int, \"larger_than_8000\": bool}, ...]\n```json```\nwould make it easier for the model, because first it needs to find the value of the transaction and right after make a comparison",
