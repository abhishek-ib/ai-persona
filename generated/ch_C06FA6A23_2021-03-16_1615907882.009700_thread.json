      "message": "Hi, could someone please help me to delete the folder in this directory (https://www.instabase.com/SA_team/demo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/UK%20KYC/workflows/) called `..` ?  I don’t know how this got created, when you try to make a folder called this, it doesn’t get created. A fun side effect of deleting this directory is that the directory 2 levels up gets deleted instead. If you try to open it you get an error, and just by being there it prevents the SDLC function working. So i’m a bit stuck what to do with it.",
