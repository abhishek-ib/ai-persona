      "message": "Yeah, also had some thoughts about this. Moving to a trash directory is easy, keeping track of when the file was deleted and then having a nb-reaper-like job to actually delete it is the more complicated part. If it were just s3, we could easily store the time of deletion in the metadata. But for NFS/other drives we don’t have this luxury.",
