      "message": ":cypress-spin: Summary of 6/10 - 6/14 Cypress On-call :slack_call:\n• Lots of tests failed on aihub-sandbox over last weekend (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C029ZG026GZ/p1718036710618509?thread_ts=1718015245.619479&cid=C029ZG026GZ) because of a change to `useAIHubUsageSummary` and the switch of the org from commercial to enterprise. This change did not affect CI runs since the org used there stayed as commercial.\n• crafting-aihub was broken for most of Tuesday because of a failed db migration (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1718136100969969?thread_ts=1718135733.338919&cid=C05L87V014J)\n• on Wednesday, we were back in business and fixed several tests! :couscous: to all!\n    ◦ @Udit fixed (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58567) a deployment API intercept so that `reviewer-dashboard` would pass\n    ◦ @Weiming Wu fixed (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58595) `view-my-hub` to check only projects created during the test\n    ◦ @danny.lan fixed (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58309) some flakiness for `aihub-extraction`, `edit-existing-app`, and `run-public-app`\n• Throughout the week, some CI runs failed because of timeouts or login issues (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1718312979777939).\n    ◦ For timeouts, reruns would often solve the issue. If there were multiple CI runs with failures only caused by timeouts, we force-merged the PR (example (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/57736)).\n    ◦ Login issues seemed to occur in PR sandboxes that have been up for a long time across crafting-aihub deployments. Deleting the sandbox and triggering a rerun resolved the issues.",
