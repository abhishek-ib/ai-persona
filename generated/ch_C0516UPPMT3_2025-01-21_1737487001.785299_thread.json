Rationale: I often find myself wanting to re-run a query with some adjustments to phrasing, etc, but instead, I need to repeat the query (with any additional file references/uploaded files [testing uploading documents in chatBOT query feature])... or worse, sometimes I need to clear the chat because I don't want new context to influence results. On top of this, sometimes the agents' response isn't consistent, and changes between attempts, taking time and adding friction to my analysis workflow.\n2. Interrupt/(or more importantly, terminate) agent response\n    a. Rationale: During chat & chatbot use, sometimes I find that I've asked the wrong query and/or used the wrong files and/or context and need to try again. However, I can't currently stop the agent response and need to wait until the (sometimes lengthy) response is completed, by which point, my natural conversation flow (and flow of thoughts/ideas/things to analyze) becomes interrupted",
