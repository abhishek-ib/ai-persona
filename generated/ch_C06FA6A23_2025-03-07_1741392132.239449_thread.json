      "message": "More along the vein of code cleanup, I'd like to clean up all our Jenkins pipelines, A large number of them are deprecated and cleaning them up will help make Jenkins more manageable and also let us clean up our build and makefiles.\n\nI started up a spreadsheet here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9bTpOQG7U9SyOblsyHa4gvs4xRYe1wqY4NOCUGnuj8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) with a list of all the pipelines I found.\n\nCan I ask everyone, especially those in infra to help:\n1. Mark *YES* for any pipeline that they know is in-use or *NO* if you know it should be/can be deleted.\n2. Add a description for pipelines you're familiar with (what it's for, or why it can be deleted, or just any context at all even if you're unsure)\n3. If you own/built a pipeline, put your name or your team down as the owner. \nIf there are any pipelines that no one can provide any information on, I'll assume are deprecated and we will just delete them.",
