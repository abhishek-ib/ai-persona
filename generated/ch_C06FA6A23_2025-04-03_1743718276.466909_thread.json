We will *not* be changing the URL for PreProd Jenkins as part of this migration, but instead will plan that for a later date. This was just an unneeded variable, and it'd behoove all of us to reduce those!\n    a. Since the URL won't be changing, I won't need to redeploy Sandbox ICC either. :+1:\n2. To clarify on the 'rollback' plan and its viability.  The procedure is grouped into pre- and post-DNS cutover phases, and as such:\n    a. If there is a blocking validation failure, we'll simply not cutover DNS, address the blockers and try again next week.\n    b. If the validation steps pass and there are *post-DNS cutover* issues that come up, rolling back to GCP is not advised and we'll only do so if there's no other path to resolution.\nCC: <!subteam^S08AA13VAFQ> @sudeep @jayapandian.ponraj @Rahul et. al. :slightly_smiling_face:",
