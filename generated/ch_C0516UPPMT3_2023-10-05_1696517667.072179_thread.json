      "message": "For 23.39, every user can only see their personal space. This includes admins. This means that every user can only see their own apps that have been created.\n\nFor 23.43, when we introduce shared spaces, an admin will be able to access every shared space (including all user'ss personal spaces - by default these will be hidden not to clutter, but an admin can make them \"visible\" in my hub). This means an admin will be able to see the contents of every space. Apps are treated a bit differently than workspaces since they have different sharing permissions (intentionally - so you can share an app with users outside of the workspace). In 23.43, we won't support app sharing yet. This means that while an admin can see all personal workspaces, they won't be able to see all apps. And for all users, they will only be able to see apps they create, even if they originate from a shared workspace (known limitation).\n\nFor 23.45, apps will be able to be shared with the organization. All users (regular/admin) will be able to see all apps that are shared with the org. An admin still won't be able to see apps that are created by a user, but not shared with an org (since sharing of apps is separate from sharing of workspaces). They will be able to see all source projects though. We can evaluate user need further here.",
