My idea was to artificially create an IBDOC that had \"refined_phrases\" containing the data inside of the JSON object, then use that as \"input\" to an \"apply_udf\" step. But it looks like IBDOCs are serialized using protobufs (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), so unless I serialize it in the same way, iB cannot understand the IBDOC. Any ideas?",

But there seems to be a parsing error on iB when I try to run/read it, even when I `.encode('utf-8')`\n\n@arun this might actually be a super useful work around for me. Would I be able to use Fetcher to call the IB Filesystem API to read a JSON and use it as input to a flow?",
