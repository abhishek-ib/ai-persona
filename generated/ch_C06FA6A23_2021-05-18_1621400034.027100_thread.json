I want to clarify something here though, our current LayoutLM models and approaches have no current application to generic table extraction (i.e it does not currently support that and we have not looked into it at all), but this data seems useful for other algos and models that the company can explore, I’ll record this with the rest of our data :) and the form specific information might be something to look into",
