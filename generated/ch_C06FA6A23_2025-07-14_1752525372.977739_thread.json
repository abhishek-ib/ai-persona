      "message": "Hi all, I have a rather big PR ready for review:\n\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/72370\n\nI am currently testing this, but there are a lot of changes. Generally, it is Dockerfile/Makefile cleanup + switchover to using `go build` instead of `bazel`.\n\nGenerally, it's difficult to merge this piecemeal (I would be here all year probably testing each individual change), so I think we have to take a minor risk in merging this. If things break, I will be on-hand to fix them.\n\nIn the end, this change will make CI a lot more stable by removing one-off solutions in Makefiles/Dockerfiles. It will also make security deps much, much easier to patch, since there is a single Dockerfile template and a single `go.mod`.\n\nQuestions? Concerns? Please let me know.",
