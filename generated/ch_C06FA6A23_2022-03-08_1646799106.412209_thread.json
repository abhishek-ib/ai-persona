Focus efforts on core features: we can’t make everything equally reliable at the same time\n3. Assume failure & simulate failure: computers fail, mistakes are made, get good at it\n4. Fail small, reducing blast radius: failure isn’t all bad, we need to make sure we have strategies to reduce impact when it occurs\n5. Protect our infrastructure from misuse & slowly ramp up capacity: systems need clear boundaries to be built reliably\n6. Automate most things and have it self-heal: humans can’t be alerted, assemble, diagnose and mitigate within 20 minutes\n7. Improve our customer communications: transparent and timely communication builds trust\n8. Ramp up our reliability goals over time: unachievable goals don’t motivate people",
