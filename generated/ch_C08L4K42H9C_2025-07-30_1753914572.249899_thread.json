      "message": "Hey team, I have two quick follow-up questions from a call with RSA - likely for BE:\n\n1. Do we have any hard limits on the length of custom functions?\n2. Do we know if the Gemini flash work will affect how we produce confidence scores on Reasoning fields? Context: RSA wants to use reasoning fields for many of their class-level fields, and then use Ranked cross-class fields in Case Management. Confidence scores, in their experience, have been hit or miss, and we're wondering if this will be improved with these changes.\nThanks & please let me know if I should reach out to anyone else on the above!",
