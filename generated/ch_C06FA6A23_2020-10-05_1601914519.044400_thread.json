      "message": "Hi all - a few months ago, we tagged a handful of apps as `deprecated` with the plan that they would be removed from the codebase after a few months. The time has come! PLEX will be working through deleting these apps in the next sprint or so, and we are targeting having them all gone by the October release. Please reach out in <#CLBGA5A7K|> with issues or concerns.\n\nThe apps are:\n• Data Manager\n• Encrypted Drive\n• Form\n• Lens\n• Report\n• Sequencer\n• Table Refiner\n• Visual Refiner\n• Viz\nTwo other deprecated-ish apps:\n• Metrics (the standalone app is retired in favor of Settings -> Metrics)\n• Recipe Book (no longer visitable as an app, but the ability to view custom UIs/recipe book files remains)\nYou can check out the docs (https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/reference/apps/deprecated/) or the original JIRA (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/CD-96) for more context",
