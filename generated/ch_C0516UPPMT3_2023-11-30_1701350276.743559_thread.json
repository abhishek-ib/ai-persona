      "message": "Thank you. This is great feedback. We also received many questions relating to the ability to have dev, uat & prod versions of apps/solutions. The overall portability of projects and apps is important to integrators and partners. They want to be able to build an app for a client and move it between environments, or retain the IP of the app and bring it to the next client. Most partners have not embraced the idea of creating an app and making it publicly available to any paying customer.",
