      "message": "Hey team, is there an easy way for users to build custom validation functions for extracted tables in Build? It looks like tables are currently extracted as Markdown strings. If someone wants to run some validation code on a table to check specific rows or cells, it feels like it would be a very involved process for users to do so (I haven't stumbled across a simple way to convert Markdown tables to JSON/pandas etc).\n\nI know that data types are coming to AI Hub soon, and turning on that flag does change the extracted field result inside the custom function - but the result is still a string. I wonder if, given that we know the extracted result will be a table in this case, that the extracted field should be transformed into a different type before being presented to the user?",
