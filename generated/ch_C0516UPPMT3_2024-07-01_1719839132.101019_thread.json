      "message": "Catching up on this. Thanks @Jessica for clarifying that community users couldn't build integrations! Reminds me why we never built that migration path. For commercial users, we very intentionally built a migration from app based to deployment based to ensure a smooth transfer. That said, we definitely could have communicated this better. In the future we could do something like:\n• Provide a warning in release(s) ahead that integrations for apps would no longer be supported and to use deployments\n• When deployments were live, provided a stronger warning that integrations would need to be migrated to deployments and how a user could do this\ncc: @melissa.amos for us to think through next time. Outside of release notes communication, I'm weary of taking on any additional customer communication expectations.",
