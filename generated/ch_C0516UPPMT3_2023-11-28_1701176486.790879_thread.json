I'd like to get some thoughts on another user need.\n\nLet's say a user is in build (has opened a project) within the context of a particular org and workspace. Is there a need to navigate from build to a view of all the projects within the selected workspace? to potentially view/filter/sort/search other projects?\n\n*Added a sketch to help visualize better.",

If we think my hub is more useful, I'd suggest making my hub the home page instead for an login user. That can be a different discussion though -- right now going with option 2 seems like the best & most straightforward option for me.",
