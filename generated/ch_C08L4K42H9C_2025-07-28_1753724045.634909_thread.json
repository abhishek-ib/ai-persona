This (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/build/01984278-1e0f-77c6-a653-0971bb1a942e) is the link to the project in Instabase-Sandbox org. I am trying to generate a case field via a udf which takes in a cross class field as an input. We can generate the field in build, it works correctly; however compiling the program gives this error. When I try to go back to the udf, I see that the case field arg is missing from the udf.",
