Instructions are located here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1606483977/Azure+Create+an+IB+Sandbox).\n\nHi Everyone, we’ve completed our provisioning and deployment pipelines for deploying Instabase on Azure (Thanks @sid for all the work on this). We are trying to move most of deployments over to Azure, so we request that you use Azure for all future sandbox creation. Instructions for how to turn up a sandbox on Azure are located here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1606483977/Azure+Create+an+IB+Sandbox).\n\nPlease give this pipeline and our Azure deployments a try and report any bugs or issues to myself or to @sid. Thanks!",
