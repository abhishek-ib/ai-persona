      "message": "@ayesha.ali so on the FE we have a bunch of these FE input errors for class and field names. This is actually meant for manual generation when user input need to be converted into python-safe variable names in the backend.\n\nThe errors actually got triggered for me twice in a span of maybe ~12 attempts. One is in the screenshot below, the other was \"field name cannot exceed 48 characters\". I was wondering it might be better to handle this on the BE/model side? Currently, there is no workaround in FE but to add a regenerate schema button. cc @Serena",
