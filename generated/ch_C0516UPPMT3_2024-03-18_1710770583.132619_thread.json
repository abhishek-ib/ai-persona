This is because you have the 728 opened.\n\nWhen there is only one file in scope, the scope behaves like single doc and will always have the currently opened document in scope. This is to avoid the synchronisation confusion where you are seeing a doc but the query is sent to another.",

Removing the clicked file (which the user intended to remove) and automatically switching to the last file remaining one. After this it continues single doc scope behaviour.",
