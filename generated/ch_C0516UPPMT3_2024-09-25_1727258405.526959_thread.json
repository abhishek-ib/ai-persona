      "message": "Hi team - sharing feedback on using search - this is probably more so a content issue than a product issue but sharing in case it's helpful (and I can't tell)\n\nWhat I want to do: A prospect has asked for a list of use cases and case studies for Shared Services / Global Business Services teams (Finance, Supply Chain, HR, Legal etc) that they can explore in their own organisation. These should be use cases in production with customers.\n\n1. 1st screenshot - this list is essentially what I'm looking for but I don't think it is true that these are live in production. \n2. 2nd screenshot - i asked a follow up question to validate if these are in production, but it then brought up customers and use cases not previously mentioned (and not in scope). If the 'follow up question' does not actually remember the previous question then i think the _\"ask a follow up question'_ prompt in the search bar is misleading \n3. 3rd screenshot - the answers here are in the right ball park, but when looking at the reference documents these aren't actually in production, and the output is hard to follow (which is due to my prompt)\n4. 4th screenshot - i added the last line for the output i want. This is the ideal format, but now only JPMC use cases are shown \nLet me know if you have any questions (and any feedback on my poor prompting skills lol) - this document is the closest I've found to answering my question - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D-rS6LpaCao0p4_RklW8ke1Vl6vpAlm1jtMoh6x8T-A/edit?gid=0#gid=0 but not sure if it's in the Search document corpus",
