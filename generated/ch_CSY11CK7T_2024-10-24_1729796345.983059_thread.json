      "message": ":cypress-spin: Hey team! I merged in a PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/64262) to run all Cypress tests when a feature flag's tier is changed. Whenever `env-local-feature-flags.json` files is changed, it will run all Cypress tests and mock the feature flag API request based on the newly updated feature flag stages. Steps to update feature flag stage (also in the doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbszN-7RRfv6uSYcdGzLmcEumy1dYu5xM8Nazp1TJBs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ute83e559ays)):\n1. Open a PR with feature flag stage changes\n2. All Cypress tests will run. Fix any tests that are broken due to the feature flag stage change\n3. Merge the PR\n4. Redeploy crafting-cyp's apps-server, webapp, api-server to pick up the feature flag stage change. \nFYI, we can still enable/disable feature flags in individual Cypress tests. So, if tests are hard to fix, you can do that for now and follow up later.\n\nPlease rebase your PR if Cypress CI pipeline is broken on your branches. I'll try to fix any bugs that come up asap.",
