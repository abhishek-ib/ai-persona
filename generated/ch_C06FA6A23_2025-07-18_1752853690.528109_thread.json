IBWeaviate has the proxy layer over weaviate which caused a lot of issues last time we tried to upgrade and is significant effort. weaviate-titan which we deployed for search is on 1.29. The plan was to move to the new weaviate in Q2 and deprecate IBWeaviate but it got deprioritized. Chatbots are still getting moved to weaviate-titan with converse and build slated for early Q3 at which point we 'll deprecate IBWeaviate.",

To address this, we cloned the upstream source code, resolved the Go dependencies using `go get`, and built the image manually using `go build`.\n\nAdditionally, since Weaviate is still under active development, their team is sometimes not fully aware of potential data loss scenarios. Given this uncertainty, I prefer not to upgrade to newer versions too frequently. For this reason, Iâ€™ve also modified the Weaviate Titan Dockerfile to build internally, giving us more control over the image and its dependencies.",
