      "message": "This is for PreProd AI Hub Build. Two things:\n\n1. I had an excel sheet with a large table, but it didnt recognize it as a table. When I corrected the field to \"Table\", it worked fine (which by the way is an enormous improvement!!). It is somehow unintuitive that AI Hub first tries to find a Single Field and gives a weird answer, and only corrects itself when you change to Table\n2. For Output, we give the option to download as an excel or csv. Two things: it seems to store al the numbers as text strings. I pushes it out in an unintuitive format. I think it is fine for CSV, but for excel I'd have expected an ordinary vertical table.\nVideo here (https://www.loom.com/share/4a2a13918d254d0a97882c2e96392cf0?sid=8500bfb1-195e-47a5-a05f-eabdb0dadbf8), PW: 9krq9nuc",
