The client came in person to the Deloitte offices to see a solution that they had built with help from our team over the last few weeks, but downtime/maintenance to the US MT env during their daytime meant they were not able to show anything.\n\nHow can we stop this happening again (particularly for our international opportunities that often are online during US night)?\n\ncc @Piyush @Aditi @subbu @Josh Rad",

The two tickets addressing those are:\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3495\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3695\n\nIn the meantime, the best we can do is make sure clients are aware that maintenance for US MT environments occurs late at night EST time. @jtau can you confirm the exact start and end times of maintenance to US MT so the team here can note them down and educate customers?\n\nAlso @jtau, if an international customer (e.g. based in Australia) is on a US MT instance, does this mean they are bound to EST maintenance times? Wonder if there is a way for us to address this.",
