      "message": "Hi folks, I experienced some incorrect behavior on converse in AIHub prod. *Context* - we wanted to extract all of the emails from a set of 5 images so I uploaded them to converse. There were 50 emails across the 5 images, but it was only able to extract 40 of them. When asked how many emails there were, it also stated 40. I then clarified that there should be 50 emails, it then created a list of 50 emails but it used some duplicates instead of correctly extracting the right ones. Potentially some kind of issue with indexing the emails?  Attached below are the images used for extraction and the chat history",
