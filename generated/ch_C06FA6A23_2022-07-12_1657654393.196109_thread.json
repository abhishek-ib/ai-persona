      "message": "Hi everyone, heads up for the upcoming prod deployment today! As the first step of the request routing framework project, weâ€™ve rolled out an envoy proxy (https://www.envoyproxy.io/) for the requests going to the ocr-msft-v3 and ocr-msft-lite containers in the July release. The proxy will run as a sidecar with the msft containers and is exporting stats to prometheus to provide useful operational insights and troubleshooting. This enables us to build mTLS, improve our request routing capabilities, and also protect the server in the future. As for now, we are not setting any connection/throughput limitations on the proxy (coming soon in the next release). We will continue to tune this as we have more insights on the prod usage. Please feel free to reach out to <#C0347F6EGDV|> if you have any questions.",
