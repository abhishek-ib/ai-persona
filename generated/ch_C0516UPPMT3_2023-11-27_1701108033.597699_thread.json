I would assume it would take me back to explore since thats the home of aihub.xxx.com (http://aihub.xxx.com), then when you click it in my apps it takes you to explore. Its very confusing and make my demo confusing to the customer",

Explore is intended to only be the starting point for new users only.\n\nWithin My Hub a user will be able to search across all conversations, projects and start new conversations and projects.\n\nOut of curiosity, @joshbronko @Lee @Tom do you think renaming it from \"Home\" to \"My Hub\" would solve this or is there other user need to go to \"Explore\" rather than \"My Hub\" directly that we're missing?\n\ncc: @Siya @Xindi Xu",

      "message": "Yes good catch! We were actually planning to update as follows, where all places said \"home\" with a home icon. When you pressed \"Home\" you were always taken to the \"home\" of that asset:\n• Home in converse -> goes to the conversation page of the open workspace in my hub\n• Home in build -> goes to the project page of the open workspace in my hub\n• Home in a custom app -> goes to app page in the org context\nBut we can adjust this based on feedback. A few other options:\n1. In all places we have \"home\" with home icon and it takes you to the home of the asset (described above)\n    a. Pro: navigates a user to where they most likely need to be\n    b. Con: no consistent \"home\" experience - brings to different pages\n2. In all places we have \"Home\" with home icon which takes you to Explore \n    a. Pro: consistent experience\n    b. Con: user can't really do anything at explore and needs several clicks to get back\n3. In all places we have \"My Hub\" with home icon which takes you to My Hub\n    a. Pro: consistent experience\n    b. Con: doesn't really make sense for apps that no longer live in my hub\n4. Build and Converse have \"My Hub\" with home icon which takes you to My Hub; custom app leads you to \"Apps\" with different icon\n    a. Pro: most descriptive; takes users where they're likely to go\n    b. Con: not consistent across build,converse, custom app\nWith these options and feedback above about Home not being clear, I'd be in favor of option 4. What are your thoughts @joshbronko @Lee @Tom?",
