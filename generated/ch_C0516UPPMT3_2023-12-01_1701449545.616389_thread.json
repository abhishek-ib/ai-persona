      "message": "I see what you’re saying, Bas, but the more I dig into it, the less sure I am that there’s an issue here.\n\nFirst, there is no duplicate page. Google understands that `/pricing-policy/` and `pricing-policy/index.html` point to the same content and source. Google search itself already selects `/pricing-policy/` as the canonical version, so there’s no need I can discern to manually designate it in files.  Certainly if you google AI Hub pricing, no index.html result is returned.\n\nSo as I understand the request to mark all index.html files as canonical repeats work Google is already doing, based on the standard way that HTML files work. To me, this seems like a false positive from the tooling.\n\nThe only other reason I can see for this issue is if there is a link somewhere that points directly to the index.html instead of to the `pricing-policy` directory, but I couldn’t find any such link in the docs or in the instabase code repo.",

If you hit `/pricing-policy/` with a browser, the browser will implicitly append `index.html` to the the end of that URL, and retrieve the page from `/pricing-policy/index.html`. So both URLs work with the browser, but there’s only one page being served by the site regardless of which URL you hit with the browser.",
