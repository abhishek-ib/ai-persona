What I was able to find is that the error is coming from `changeRecordClassificationReducer` while trying to figure out if the previous step was a refiner step. It's either because the `currentStepId` of the record is null or one of the steps in the output schema is missing a step id. Udit will hopefully know which one of those is more likely and how it happened.",
