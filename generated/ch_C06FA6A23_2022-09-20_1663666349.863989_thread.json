      "message": "Hi team,\n\nAs you know, we recently changed the default OCR from google to microsoft on ib.com (http://ib.com) as a cost saving measure. We are now planning to make the same change in the dogfood environment as well.\nThis change will take place tomorrow*, 21 Sept 12PM IST*. Since this will break some golden tests, we are requesting the test owners to update their respective flows from the default OCR engine to msft-ocr by *Friday 23 Sept* so that we can have our golden-tests back to green before the weekend starts.\nThis doc is tracking the golden-tests that need to be updated: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15dtthHs0XyHJzblgUhthVEHotjHL-zmph5ysqvHeXVk/edit. Please update here once your changes are complete. Thanks! :babyyoda:\n\nTagging owners for the tests that need to be changed: @Anil @lydia @Aayush @Franklin Chian @Elan Sharony\n\ncc: @Hari @Rakesh",
