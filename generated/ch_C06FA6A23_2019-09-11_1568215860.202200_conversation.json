Driven by deep learning, it’s entering a new phase where it first recognizes scanned text, then makes meaning of it. The competitive edge will be given to the software that provides the most powerful information extraction and highest-quality insights. And since each business category has its own particular document types, structures and considerations, there’s room for multiple companies to succeed based on vertical-specific competencies.\n```",
