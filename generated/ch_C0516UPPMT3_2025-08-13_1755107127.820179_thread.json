Currently clicking on this takes to Instabase Zendesk protal for reporting bug.\n\nCurrently, JPMC has a process where users log tickets in their internal portal, which is reviewed by their CTO team, and a Zendesk ticket is raised with Instabase only if required. To provide a seamless experience for their users, they are checking if this banner’s destination is configurable to their portal.\ncc - @jade.kelly",
