I’ve noticed a bunch of bugs go through in PRs (even some mypy issues) that get caught by the Jenkins image-tasks tests. At first I thought maybe it was a problem with `make test-changes`, but now I see image-tasks is listed in `MODULES_TO_IGNORE`, which I assume comes from those issues a few weeks ago",
