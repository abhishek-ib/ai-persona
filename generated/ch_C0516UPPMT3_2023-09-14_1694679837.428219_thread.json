I’ll investigate.\n\nOne non-obvious thing that is different in the multi-step reasoning vs the old Converse is that we have a continuous conversation rather than independent prompts. If you ask serveral things all the past questions/answers and document context gets passed to the model too, and maybe that’s what’s confusing it. If you don’t want that you can send a message `\"reset\"`  between unrelated queries. There would need to be a UI support for that eventually, but that’s what we have in the prototype today.",
