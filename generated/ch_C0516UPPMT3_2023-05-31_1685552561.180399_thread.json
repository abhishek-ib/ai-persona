For example, I have 25 documents in a conversation, but only the ability to converse with one document at a time.",

      "message": "Thanks a lot for the feedback, @John O'Hara.\n\nCouple of follow up Qs:\n• Did you try the same 25 docs for uploading? The system was quite stressed yesterday, so difference in loading performance is not unexpected. \n• re: sorting of docs, would you expect a different order once everything has uploaded? Will any sorting order changes (post the initial upload experience) be jarring? \nSupporting queries for multiple docs is the most requested feature across users. It is also a ton of work :slightly_smiling_face: We are going to focus on this in Q2, stay tuned!",
