Would it make sense to have a copy of our code on opengrok so that it is searchable by anyone without needing access to the github (which can be potentially dangerous and also overwhelming to people unaware of git)? This way, if there are critical issues and if there is anyone who would like to lookup the code to find out the piece of code causing it he will find it easier?\n\nhttps://oracle.github.io/opengrok/",
