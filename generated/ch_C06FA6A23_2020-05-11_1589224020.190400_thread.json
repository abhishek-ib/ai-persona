This involves updating the templates for every single app, and while we’re trying to be as careful as possible not to break pre-existing flows, things will unfortunately slip through the cracks. We know firsthand the pain of feeling like your dev setup is changing underneath you, and we’re sorry if you’ve felt this so far. \n\nIf, after pulling master, you find an app is no longer working, try restarting apps-server and webapp. This should fix most issues. \n\nIf you never run Webpack locally (for local frontend app development), you can skip this paragraph. If you do run Webpack locally, the process is unfortunately more complicated. If the app you want to develop on has been migrated, you’ll run yarn bundle-local:beta (which builds and serves the new Webpack bundles). You can consult this spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLurZjqT0zAZNgDgNuhUB_NDQ90BxV8yBG23mqz-CIc/edit#gid=0) to see which apps have already been migrated. Once the migrations are complete, we’ll remove the legacy build option and restore yarn bundle-local as the only command needed to run Webpack locally (and communicate this out). \n\nThis is one of those processes that can be painful in the moment, but will pay significant dividends in the future by allowing us to ship new apps quickly and reducing complexity in the codebase. Thanks for your patience - if you run into issues please reach out in <#CLBGA5A7K|> or message @cross talk - a podcast about crosswords - listen on apple podcasts or spotify and @John St.",
