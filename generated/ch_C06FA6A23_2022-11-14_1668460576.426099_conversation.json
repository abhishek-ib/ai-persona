      "message": "With talk of making sure to run `make test` for mypy errors and such before merging PRs, I wanted to bring up this thread. Me and it seems a couple other M1 chip users haven't been able to run `make test` in api-server-apps or any other service folders I've tried without getting this error: `b'rosetta error: unexpectedly need to EmulateForward on a synchronous exception x86_rip=0x4378000000 arm_pc=0x4382577092 num_insts=6 inst_index=2 x86 instruction bytes: 0x6215344901283465301 0x17042544937633142081\\n'`. Does anyone know how to fix this so we can check mypy errors without having to commit+push and wait on jenkins to evaluate?
