      "message": "<!here> Hi team,\nAs one of the measures for driving our infrastructure costs down, we will be changing the default OCR from Google-OCR to Microsoft-OCR to reduce the no of calls we are making to the Google-OCR.\n\nQ: When and how?\nA: We will making this change in phased approach. In the first phase, we will update the prod environment (instabase.com (http://instabase.com)) on 2 Sept 12:00PM IST. Since our existing golden tests will fail due to this change environments like dogfood, UAT and release sandboxes will be updated next week.\n\nQ: What does this mean for my solutions?\nA: Any flows and solutions using `OCR Model Type` as `default` can break due to a difference in process-files output.\n\nQ: What is the recommended fix?\nA: We would recommend migrating the flows/solutions to use the Microsoft-OCR since we want to reduce the dependency on Google-OCR. If your flow absolutely needs Google-OCR, then you should change the `OCR Model Type` to `Google Vision`.",
