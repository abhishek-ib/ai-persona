I noticed `protoc-gen-go` wasn't installed in there for me so I tried to do `go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest (http://google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest)` but it complains that it can't install on Go 1.18. Any suggestions for next steps @sean.donohoe?",
