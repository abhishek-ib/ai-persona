      "message": "ah thanks serena for lookin into the backend part of this as well, I'm looking at the generated case program, seeing that `class_field_value` you linked (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/79052fc/shared-utils/py-utils/data-api-utils/src/py/instabase/data_api_utils/_sheet/lambda_fns.py#L138-L139) comes from the `class_field` param which is the output of the `get_intra_class_field` native function and that's capable of returning a dictionary (which I can observe when running a flow). So depending on `get_intra_class_field` output, we could get smth like `{\"W2\": {\"employee_name\": {\"value\": \"John Doe\", \"model_confidence\": 0.9}}}`\n\nSo hmm, we'll have to look closer into why this isn't accessible, but I do know the value of `get_intra_class_field` comes from FE `class_field_values` for the `/case_extraction` case, so ya let me investigate",

      "message": "i'm confused about what the parameters for packet args is for `udfs/run` i think the idea was that the frontend would pass in the entire class fields dictionary not just the classfields[class][field][value]? the new intra class field api returns this dictionary which should be passed directly.\n\nthe following is working for me: ss1 creating udf, ss2 `udfs/run`, ss3/4 case extraction. i think we just need the argument to be class_fields",
