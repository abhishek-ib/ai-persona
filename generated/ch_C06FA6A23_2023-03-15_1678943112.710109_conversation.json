      "message": "[Announcement] Api Server Apps removal.\n\nA majority of the work to eliminate api-server-apps as a separate service and moving the functionality to api-server is done. Dogfood and sandboxes won't have api-server-apps running anymore and UAT, Prod will get the same changes with the next release. Few things to consider for developers, IB users are:\n\n1. If you are making any config changes such as env vars, resourcing, network policies etc that were intended for api-server-apps then those need to be applied to api-server instead.\n2. For local development, server-nginx and api-server needs to be recompiled. Here are some pro-tips from @Serena: `ppy compile --use-prebuilt` if they donâ€™t have any local changes to `server-nginx` / `api-server` / `api-server-apps`\n3. If you are making code changes to api-server-apps, you can continue to do so as before except for a couple of cases. These won't be needed eventually as the whole webserver/api-server-apps directory will be deleted and relevant code moved under webserver/api-server but that step will take a few more days.\n    a. Any changes to dependencies (pyproject.toml for example) needs to be replicated to api-server\n    b. Any changes to config.py needs to be replicated to api-server",
