In fact a customer (unum) basically implemented this on their end already using converse APIs (cc: @Hannah)!\n\n@Orlando would be good to understand a few things for RenRe. Will be helpful as we work on designing for this.\n1. What are the docs being processed by their app as a batch? What type of contracts?\n2. Who are the users reviewing the batch results? \n3. What are some examples of data points extracted by the build app? \n4. What are a few questions their reviewers may want to ask in a chat with the docs and batch output?",

      "message": "Nice, I’m about to post that in the RenRe teams chat:\n\n_We’re exploring a new capability within AI Hub that would enhance the way users gain insights into documents that are commonly automated._\n_In AI Hub, we enable users to converse with a set of documents to gather insights, and we allow users to build apps that identify and extract information in an automated fashion. The new feature capability would combine these two functions: allowing users to converse with the extracted information once it has been processed, as well as with the original document set._\n_A Potential User Journey Scenario:_\n1. _*Batch Processing:*_\n    ◦ _I receive a batch of contracts that need to be processed and sent to a destination system. I also want to interrogate the data and documents once they’ve been processed._\n2. _*Uploading Documents:*_\n    ◦ _As an AI Hub user, I upload contracts to the “Contract Clause Extraction app.”_\n3. _*App Processing:*_\n    ◦ _The app runs as a typical build app, extracting and validating the information as configured in the solution._\n4. _*Post-Processing:*_\n    ◦ _Once the batch of documents is completed, I can go into AI Hub where a converse-like interface is available._\n5. _*Interactive Interface:*_\n    ◦ _From this interface, much like what is currently possible in Converse, I can see the documents and add them to the scope of my prompts._\n6. _*Accessing Extracted Information:*_\n    ◦ _Alongside the documents, I can also see the information that has been extracted and processed for the destination system._\n7. _*Custom and Prepopulated Prompts:*_\n    ◦ _I can choose from a number of prepopulated prompts (which I’ve either asked before for similar documents, or other people in my company have asked), or I can ask my own questions as I would with Converse._",
