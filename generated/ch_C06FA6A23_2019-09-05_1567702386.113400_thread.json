Need extra settings for refactor/visual refiner to run \n2. Need extra settings for provenance tracking\n3. Tweaking random OCR settings for better results \n4. Language support \n\nIs there a middle ground where you can have a check box that has enable:\n-Provenance Tracking \n-Visual Refiner \n-Language Code\n\nThen maybe some extended settings for OCR tweaks.\n\nThis is just initial thoughts",

I’m generally a fan of the iterative approach, but understand that building from the ground up can help in certain cases. Will let you all make the call, since that specific OCR options is an existing pain point, it would be pretty awesome to have in a more scoped timeframe if possible!",
