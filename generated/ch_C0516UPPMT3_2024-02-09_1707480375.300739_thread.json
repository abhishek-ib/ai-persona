In future (Q1 intiiative) as build gets OCR configuration settings that would enable selecting only non-Latin language only.  If you are not using table extraction here - then this removal within detected table wont affect your regular queries as those still use OCR results.\nWhat query are you using currently in Build to extract ? Also the LLM results for non-latin languages are not benchmarked as I understand and is not currently prioiritised.",

I'm less interested in the foreign language aspect but wonder if this is similar to the date formatting issue, that some of our custom smart rules when applying on data in the wild actually becomes too optimize for our own benchmarking dataset / less robust cc @Hari Let's understand this to give us a peace of mind, after we know the root cause we can decide whether to fix it or not.\n\n@Gwen if you want to bypass table extractor, go to build and use the extraction mode instead of the reasoning mode. You can type in full sentence prompt there too.",
