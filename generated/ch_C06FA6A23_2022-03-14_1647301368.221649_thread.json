      "message": "Hey all!\n\nI wanted to extend an invite to everyone to join the core-services team for a session on the “Art of Troubleshooting” hosted by @Xi Cheng. Xi has built up quite a collection of tools for debugging all sorts of infra issues, from performance to scalability issues, in ours environments and in some of our favourite customer environments. He has a bunch of helpful tips for what tools to use and when, what to make of the results, and also a few case studies for some of the most memorable issues he’s root caused.\n\nI’ve scheduled it for Wed Mar 16 at 9:30am PST. Zoom link (https://instabase.zoom.us/j/95576158208?pwd=b2ZILzlic2FLd0NtcEQ0QkgvR1h6UT09) is here for anyone interested. Can definitely invite more folks to the event directly as well!",

You won't be able to see invitation responses, and the event won't keep up with group membership changes.```\nI think your group settings might be a bit too private?
