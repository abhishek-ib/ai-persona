      "message": "Hey, the delete all classes button sits behind the close button for editing a field. I regularly double click because of slight UI delays and so far I have never clicked to delete all classes (thankfully). Now we have a big POV project I'm becoming increasingly worried that I'm going to hit delete all classes and lose the project (I don't think we have a way to undo this).\n\nMaybe we want to move the delete all classes button to a less commonly accidental click location?",
