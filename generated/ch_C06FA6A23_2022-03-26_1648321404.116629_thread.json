The default list of 3rd party python libs for UDFs is here https://instabase.com/docs/reference/udfs/libraries-for-udfs/#third-party-libraries in case customers don’t know. If they need a different version for any of these libraries please let us know instead of using the code in the doc to upgrade the version themselves. \n2. Just reading the doc, you might want to make it clear to the reader that `'pyfiglet=0.7.6'` is just an example lib and users should replace this with the library they want to install. Also, is ib-user ID always `9999` or this is something different from user to user? If so, make that clear too. \n3. This process needs to be repeated every time they receive a new image of app tasks (for using the custom libraries in the UDF). Need to make it clear too. \ncc @shaunak if anything is inaccurate here.",
