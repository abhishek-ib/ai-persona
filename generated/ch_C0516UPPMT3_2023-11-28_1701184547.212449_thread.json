      "message": "Few pieces of feedback on the design of My Hub.\n\n1. The search box is huge! \n2. All the headings are H1 (20px) it feels like ‘My Workspace’ should be H1 and the other headers H2\n3. Projects are more related to App Runs than Conversations, but the elements are far apart, I think these should be grouped (or at least closer together) \n4. When you only have a single project or conversation the add buttons are on their own and its not clear what you’re adding. \n5. Can we rename ‘Projects’ to ‘Build Projects’ it wasn’t immediately clear what a ‘Project’ was. \n@hannah",
