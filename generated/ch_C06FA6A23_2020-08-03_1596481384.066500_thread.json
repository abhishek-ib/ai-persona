      "message": "Happy Monday and here's a PSA for docs workflow (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/210665492/Docs+workflow). Questions? Ping in <#CM9TARK7U|>.\nPlan to integrate technical content changes as part of the development cycle. Don't wait until right before the release.\n> *Use Jira* to trigger and track your doc work.\n> - For big new features, *Create a Jira* for the doc work in your Jira project. Define scope, audience, technical content. Be sure to fill out the  *Affects versions* fields and provide content in whatever medium is comfortable for you. Link the new Jira to the original Jira.\n> - For minor doc updates, select the *Docs > TODO* checkbox in the project Jira. \n> - When doc updates are not required, select the *Docs > Not required* checkbox.\nRelease notes (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/185696404/Release+notes) play a vital role in how we inform our users of changes and new features.\nI'm here for us all! It's better together.",
