I think as we open up to search, we should be able to have a sense of time-sensitivity. Perhaps we could add an agent tool/step to lean in on time.\n\n```Has anyone asked me for something I should respond to with urgency in Slack?\n\nResponse\nYes, there is an indication of an urgent request in Slack. In the \"Post Mortem - 2021-07-10 FRB: Disk Full\" document, it is mentioned that an escalation was raised through Slack and phone calls, which resulted in engineers being called over the phones and messaged on Slack threads over the weekend[1].```\nReferring to something from 2021 as urgent is not the result I was looking for.
