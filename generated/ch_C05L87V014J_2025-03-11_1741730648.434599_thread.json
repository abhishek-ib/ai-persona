I'm kicking myself for not seeing this before -- the sandboxes which have been working fine don't have a `~/.bash_profile` defined, meaning they fell back on the `BASH_ENV=/etc/sandbox.d/bash_env` environment variable I added to catch those contexts. Both of your hosts have `~/.bash_profile` defined, without the initialization snippet that's in `/etc/sandbox.d/bash_env`, so it was getting skipped -- adding the snippet to `~/.bash_profile`  seems to have fixed it, I'll put up a PR to do this automatically for people in a little bit!",
