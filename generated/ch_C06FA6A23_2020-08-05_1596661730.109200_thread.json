I'm not sure investing resources into a new language is the best use of our time. To some extent \"refiner formulas\" are just our version of that. Are there particular \"regexes\" you'd like to see turned into easy-to-use functions? Could have a whole mission in Ideanote dedicated to new function ideas for app-eng :blush:",
