I'm not sure why customers would think that this is broken behavior - @Lee could you elaborate on the feedback on this?\n\na `204` response code (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204) is a successful HTTP response code. In general `2XX` codes denote successful responses. Changing this to another 2xx code is trivial implementation wise but since this is a public API, it's not that easy to flip the switch if people have been using it",
