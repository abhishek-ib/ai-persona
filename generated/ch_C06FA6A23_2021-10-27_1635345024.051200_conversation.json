      "message": "Hi all — as we’re thinking about Q4 OKRs, I wanted to surface this doc from a year ago: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdAMsf89czOQOFBdsnFkyUS-ZpZfjzdtYjDkkYey1to/edit#heading=h.ydafv28ibdyf. Addressing the number of services we have and tech debt generated from the proliferation of services is an important investment in the stability of our platform. Alongside what Anil mentioned above, it leads to a number of real issues, creating significant instability, some are:\n• Increased network traffic that accounts for service <-> service traffic (i.e. how many network requests go into a single flow run?)\n• Decreased resource utilization caused by a baseline occupancy of each service (even a service with no utilization, doesn’t go down to 0 resources, so it is always occupying some resources that cannot be shared)\n• More recently — occupancy of open database connections (databases have a finite number of open connections that they can handle, we have many services that now talk to the database, each is occupying connections that could otherwise be shared).\nThe doc is a bit out of date, since it’s from last year, but all of these issues still remain open. Please let me know if you have any concerns.",
