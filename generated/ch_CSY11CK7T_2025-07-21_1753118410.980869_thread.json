Go to https://d-9067ba412e.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts\n3. Go to `instabase-dev` > `aws-powerUserAccess` > `Access keys`\n4. Copy Option 1 (the one with `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...` )\n5. Paste your clipboard (that exports AWS credentials) into your sandbox ssh\n6. Then run this god forsaken one-liner in your sandbox:\n```echo -e '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"'$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2)'\"' \\\n  | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/aws.tmp > /dev/null \\\n  && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aws.tmp \\\n  && sudo mv /usr/local/bin/aws.tmp /usr/local/bin/aws ```\n7. In a browser, visit https://instabase.sandboxes.site/sandboxes and find your sandbox\n8. Suspend your sandbox, then resume it.\n9. Go into your Github Cypress action and re-run all jobs.\n\nYour sandbox should be working after 10 minutes + get Cypress results in your PR.\n\nLet me know if you have issues",
