      "message": "*Derived Fields Feedback*\nHey team, been playing around with the Derived Fields flag - overall wow, this is going to be such a good addition :raised_hands: Couple of pieces of feedback, mainly around the UX:\n1. Hitting `'Enter'` while in the prompt box gives you a new line. This is inconsistent with other fields where it runs the prompt\n2. We need a better way to nudge users on how to use this field. Maybe just auto-filling the box with a greyed out suggestion that disappears when you type?\n3. Instead of field suggestions popping up automatically, I think it should require the '@' symbol. Makes it cleaner when typing. I also think field names should be more differentiated from normal text (its only bold atm)\n4. How does this work? Are we creating code in the background or are the fields and task being sent to an LLM?\n    a. If the user can't quite get what they want in terms of behaviour, they could tweak code. If its the latter option, I think they'd have to fall back to a custom function field and start coding from scratch\n5. Can we use this flow for prompt-based validations? Generally I avoid using these as they are slow, confusing and often produce errors. Using derived fields was a much better experience overall :blush:",
