I'm specifically looking for approvals/rejections from @mfichman and @Cody Boggs, however I would love to hear from anyone who is interested! (This also introduces cue (https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/) to the stack, so on the off chance anyone here has prior exposure I would love your feedback as well!)",
