We do have a feedback link at instabase.com/feedback (http://instabase.com/feedback), but that pipes to an email address that will make results hard to track. I'd like to still have it be possible for on-prem customers to give us feedback, but not pipe to an email address.\n\nOn-prem deployments cannot use external APIs, correct? So we wouldn't be able to use Google form APIs or anything in that feedback form? If we directed them to about.instabase.com (http://about.instabase.com) and had them fill out a feedback form there, they would be able to send their feedback through that, right?",
