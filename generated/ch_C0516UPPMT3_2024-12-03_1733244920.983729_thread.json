On a large monitor this is 2-3 drags away from the config area.\n2.  The 'Cancel', 'X' and 'Settings' all do the same action when you are in the settings page.\nIf this is considering any other scenarios and need to be there, at least key 'esc' to close would be very user friendly!",

I agree that having the buttons closer together will make the experience more cohesive and intuitive. Let me track this.",
