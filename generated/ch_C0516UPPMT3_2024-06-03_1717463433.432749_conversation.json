      "message": "With the release of 24.20, I'd would love to get everyone to start testing some of our critical features that will be part of the initial launch of AI Hub Enterprise including:\n• *Workspace revamp:* My Hub has been renamed to Workspaces and contains your projects, conversations, deployments and data sources. Within workspaces, an All Workspace tab now aggregates activities across all workspaces you can access. \n• *Deploy*: Create deployments to configure upstream integrations, downstream integrations and human review settings. All deployments can be monitored in a consolidated deployment dashboard.\n• *Document-based Review*: Review the results from application runs and correct any inaccuracies across documents extractions or reasoning prompts.\nTo test these capabilities go to settings -> account -> internal preview features -> turn on *Workspace Revamp.* Turning on this feature flag will enable everything listed above. In 24.22, you can start testing running advanced apps on AI Hub. Please share feedback on these features in this thread, in this channel or directly to any PM. These features are slated to GA in 24.24\n\nHuge thanks to the entire team working on these critical features for our enterprises including, but definitely not limited to:\n• Eng: @Abhishek Adupa @Adam @andy  @Anil @daniel @Elan Sharony @Jag @Jessica @Liam Callanan @Paul H @Serena @tony.shi @Travis @Udit  @Wilson \n• PM: @Bastiane @Kaustubh (KD) \n• Design: @alagu @Jianqi Xing  @Siya \n• Docs: @melissa.amos @Rosie",
