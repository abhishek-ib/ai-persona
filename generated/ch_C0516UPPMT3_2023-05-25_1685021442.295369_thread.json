I was trying AiHub for the first time and I randomly uploaded one of the screenshots I have and given few prompts as well.\nIt seems the model would not pickup the previous Prompt given. I mean first I asked whether we have Investor name and as a follow up I asked the value for that field without mentioning the field name. Is this the expected behaviour?",
