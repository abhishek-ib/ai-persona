      "message": "Revisiting @Xindi Xu’s #3 idea to add a label to still run a test in CI but have it not block merging -\n\nWe obviously need to use it sparingly, but I actually really like this idea for the specific case of new tests. We recently added tests for deployments, advanced apps, and review, and we ended up seeing issues with concurrency and sheer volume that we couldn't have anticipated from testing locally. We can think of new tests as having a \"baking\" period where we want to see the results but they shouldn't be blocking. Thoughts?",
