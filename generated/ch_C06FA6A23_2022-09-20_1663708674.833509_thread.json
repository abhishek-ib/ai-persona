But I think something changed in webserver (specifically this pr (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/29650)) that made the tests and its build break, and now i'm having trouble rebuilding due to the below error if i run `make test`\n``` error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"instabase.apps_server.server.config.BaseConfig\", variable has type \"instabase.server.config.BaseConfig\")```\nand this error when i run `make build mypy`\n```instabase/table_utils/tableclient_grpc.py:372: error: \"TableServiceStub\" has no attribute \"InsertBulk\"```\nDo you know what might be up here?",
