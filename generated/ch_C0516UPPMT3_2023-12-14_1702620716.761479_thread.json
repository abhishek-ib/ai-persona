      "message": "*Threads* :thread:  *in Converse*\n\nI do not have full visibility what’s on the roadmap and what’s not. So the following may already be in the planning. But here goes.\n\nOne of the things that frustrated me over the past two weeks was an inability to query a result further. Instead, each new request goes over the full document again. This wasn’t as much of an issue when it was a simple prompt for a short document.\n\nBut now we have Multistep and MultiDoc. For instance, if I do a big query across 6, 200 pages each, annual reports and pulled together a table of revenue across all those years - then this will take a minute, but that’s fine. It is cumbersome after all to do manually.\n\nBut if I subsequently want the cagr% over that data, my prompt will query all six documents again. This takes time and has a risk of inconsistent results.\n\nEnter Threads :thread: . It would be nice and natural, to open a thread on a result to query it further. In this case the prompt should just go over the output, not the original text. I could use this to refine outcome, further summarize, bulletize something, change format, visualize the table etc.\n\nA similar but different feature would be to compare the output of a question to another output in the same conversation (instead of MultiDoc it is multi-result). \n\nThen I can start a new prompt where I really want to query all files or long 300 page report again. \n\nI guess by opening a thread, it should generate an IBDoc from the above result, add that to the file set, and use that doc as the single file to query.",
