We also ask for informal feedback related to AI Hub, as much to gauge their initial perspective on the product and encouragement to explore beyond the defined exercises.\n\nThought I'd share here what a candidate produced as \"Recommendations for Boosting AIHub Registrations\" based on their first experiences :point_down:. Maybe some useful material and insights from an external perspective (experienced candidate in account management and software engineering).",
