      "message": "The mystery has been solved - the python notebook that page was open to was loading in custom css that set the display property of elements with a certain class to `none`. Since it was custom css, it was overriding the bootstrap css for all elements of that type on the page. If we navigated to a different page, the modal worked correctly.\n\nWe'll change the css here to fix that case. In the future, we'll be more cautious about namespacing our css - i.e., if you're writing custom css for a common component, making sure to specify a container unique to that element",
