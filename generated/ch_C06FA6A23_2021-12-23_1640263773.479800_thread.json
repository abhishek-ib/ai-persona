In production we are seeing an issue where on certain days the number of runs (which iâ€™m assuming equals jobs) show higher in metrics than flows that were run in the flow dashboard\n\nDate: 20th December\nRuns in Metrics - 97\nFlows in Dashboard - 69 (counted manually after all pages refreshed)\n\nAm I correct in thinking that the flowdashboard will show every flow, without fail? If so, is there any method I can provide to JPMC to understand the number of pages processed in those flows?",
