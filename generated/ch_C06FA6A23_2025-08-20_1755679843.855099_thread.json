      "message": "Hey all! IBReviewer prototype is live now :tada:. From now on, it'll be visible as another github action by the name (:robot_face: *IBReviewer / AI Code Review (experimental)*) running in every PR. It'll post suggestion messages in your PR.\n\nCurrent capabilities:\n• Review and comment on files individually, no file has context of another file for now. (We plan to iterate and improve on it.)\n• Only reviews python files.\n• Skips reviewing empty files, moved files, _pb2.py files.\n• Post the review comments as part of a single comment instead of discussion thread.\n• This won't block merge.\nFuture improvements:\n• Better context handling (compression, parsing of code etc.) to reduce context bloat with bigger code files.\n• Smarter module detection taking code structure into account.\n• Supporting more languages like golang, TS, JS etc.\n• Support reviewing test coverage and test relevance.\nCurrent limits (to be addressed as part of above improvements):\n• Posts max 50 comments per run.\n• Upto 30 files will be reviewed per run.\n• Reviews changes to files with <1000 lines of code only, it'll skip files with code greater than that.\nPlease feel free to share any feedback/issues in this (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f1yuzqspFhzFvrRwPmYarGatJbKZ21oivhGbtoFVV8k/edit?gid=0#gid=0) sheet, we'll actively keep monitoring it & iterating to improve it and make it smarter.",
