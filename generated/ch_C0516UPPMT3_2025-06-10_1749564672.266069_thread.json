This is a massive differentiator for us and there is no easy way to demo this to our customers to showcase the value. This was very apparent in a demo today with @Aditi\n\nIf we have spare design capacity even having a Figma style mockup that we could activate with a button click would be useful in the meantime!\n\ncc @jack.robbins",

      "message": "Good to hear the dashboard is well-received!\n\nTotally hear the needs & benefits of this one, but unfortunately it won't be possible in Q2 given ongoing customer-committed priorities. However, if there is spare capacity on the soleng side / elsewhere in GTM in the short term, something outside of the product could be built to automatically replenish a demo dashboard (ongoing file generation & processing definitely seems feasible), & maybe use the legacy human review APIs like some customers do.\n\nOtherwise, a more manual workaround is to periodically upload files to the same deployment. I have a script that auto-generates simple txt docs if I need new ones - I roughly once a week upload a few files to this deployment to keep data flowing:  https://aihub.instabase.com/deployments/01922adb-aa87-7886-91b6-49e2d713ada2/metrics?asOfTime=1749570044424",
