Users should *NOT* wait for auto-hibernation\n• Sandboxes should be *deleted* by their owners when they are no longer to be used. Users should *NOT* wait to be alerted about deletion due to the deployment being idle for an extended period of time.\n• If the sandbox creation failed and the owner can't troubleshoot it until next day, make sure to *delete* the deployment before signing off for the day. Hibernation may be acceptable if the creation process went far enough to allow for it.",
