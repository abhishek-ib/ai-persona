      "message": "Question from our client Essor (via our partner Sicolos):\n> With the versioning built into apps/deployments, how can they theoretically rollback a project (not an app, but the editable fields) from a later version to an earlier version?\n> \n> For example, if they published lots of changes to the schema of a project with v3.0.0, but then decided to revert back to the old schema of v2.3.2 then edit from that point in time, how could they accomplish this?\nBasically, they're looking for git-like workflows, and want to know how they can implement their company's versioning policies with IB Build solutions.\n\nOne option that we discussed is possibly making copies of project files like one would creating git branches, but the downside I see with that is that it'd also require updating the API calls in the various integrations to reference the new project/app hierarchy and the version history would be unique to each project.  Do we have a more elegant way of handling this request?\n\ncc: @fernando.piazza.ctr",

      "message": "Okay, thank you.  And is there any kind of estimated timeline we can answer them with?  Or if not, at least could we say something like:\n> In our experience working with various organizations and a wide variety of use cases, the need to revert to an earlier project schema is so rarely required because usually the requirements don't change too drastically and the platform is simple enough to use that changing the schema back is not terribly difficult.  Our product team has this feature request on their radar, but with all the other cutting edge advances they want to make sooner, they likely won't be able to begin development on this until <month> or later.\n> \n> Somewhat relatedly, we're a bit further along on a feature request of tracking (including being able to revert) prompt histories for each field in a project, which could take most of the tediousness out of changing the state of a project back to an earlier version.  If all goes smoothly, we could see this feature released around <month> or <month>.",
