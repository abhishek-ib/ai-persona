Miscommunications between frontend/backend when restrictions are added on backend and frontend is not aware of them (like character or length restrictions)\n2.

Frontend engineer attention to these validations - lots of things to think about during implementation and sometimes these things do get missed! We'll chat about this in the next frontend guild just to bring this into the top of people's awareness",
