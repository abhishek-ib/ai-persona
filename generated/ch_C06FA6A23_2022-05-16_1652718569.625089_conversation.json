For NLP processing (e.g. *nlp_token_find()* function), what are the options available for *model_config* and *tokenizer_config*? I searched in the documentation and the list of all available options for these two arguments were not available - only a few examples were given (e.g. *map_create* is available for tokenizer_config).   Is there any further documentation available.",

Can the person-name model be used to do this, or would this require a custom implementation? How would we address more unique or uncommon names not included in the *person-name* model?",
