      "message": "Ground truth datasets: Updating ground truth dataset values:\n\nI've created a ground truth dataset for an app that initially extracted tables w/ dates as is from bank statements. The ground truth values were set to be the as-is extracted formats. For example, if the document had dates that read `Mar 01`, the extracted date would be `Mar 01` -- the ground truth value was set accordingly to also be `Mar 01`.\n\nI've now updated my app to include a cleaning step in-line after the table is extracted that effectively reformats all dates to adopt `MM/DD/YYYY` format.\n\n*Feedback:*\nI really liked how initially, you can set ground truth values by updating extracted values. Going back to update the ground truth values, I was looking for a way to re-run the extractions with the updates cleaning steps, but I couldn't find (easily, at least) how to re-run the files using the updated app config to get to the point where I can just update the extracted values like how I was able to do when initially creating the GT dataset.\n\n*Question:* \nIs there a way to re-run the app so I can just update the many rows of dates instead of doing them manually one by one?\n\nI read somewhere in another thread that we can't delete ground truth datasets, and I think we should avoid having to create another duplicate set by manually selecting and re-uploading the same \"project\" files, which are what I used to create the initial ground truth dataset.",
