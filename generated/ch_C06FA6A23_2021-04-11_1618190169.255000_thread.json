Couple things that stood out to me —\n• Their UX for work queue (https://youtu.be/OIzjmNoV37Q?t=111) and human review was pretty neat.  [Glad we are moving in that direction already :slightly_smiling_face: ]\n• The input is not very hard but the end to end business solution using integration with uipath makes it pretty powerful. [Have we considered such partnerships with UIPath like them? Like IB being the extraction partner for an end to end RPA cust of UiPath.]",
