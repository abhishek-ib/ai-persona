      "message": "Hi team, I wanted to bring awareness to an issue that I've been dealing with relating to using Python 3.9 in most/all of our web services, while using Python 3.7 in the Jenkins CI build for shared utils. I believe this issue has been raised in the past, but I'm not sure of a good workaround:\n\nRecently, we've upgraded the `pandas`  package to `1.5.3`  across api-server, apps-server, and celery-app-tasks. But since `pandas==1.3`  is the last version compatible with Python 3.7, we are unable to make a similar change to `tools/devtools/code-dependencies/python/requirements.base.in` and continue to use `pandas==1.1.0`. This mismatch forces me to change my usage of `pandas`  solely to pass the Jenkins build, rather than how we will use the library in practice on the platform. I think specifically for my case, there is a path forward to modify my implementation such that our usage of `pandas`  is valid across both versions, but I'd imagine that will not always be true for other dependency version mismatches.\n\nDo we have a plan to upgrade to Python 3.9 for our Jenkins build shared utils tests, so that we can be certain that we match the versions of our python dependencies that are used in practice?",
