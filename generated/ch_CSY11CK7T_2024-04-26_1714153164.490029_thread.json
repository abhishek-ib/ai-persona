This is intended so that the user is aware that an operation is ongoing. The loading toast can disappear if (1) the user closes it, (2) the same toast id is used for a success or error toast, or (3) the loading toast was set as low-priority https://github.com/instabase/javascript-packages/tree/main/packages/toast#toast-config\n\nIn Pollen, loading toasts do automatically disappear after a timeout - is this intended? @Xindi Xu @Liam Callanan",
