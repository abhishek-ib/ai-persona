      "message": "Hi team, had a call with a commercial customer we are looking to start a POC with, and they raised a fair concern about security I hadn't heard before.\n\n_\"What protections does AI Hub have in place to stop anyone in the workspace downloading data to their personal machine? We might be okay without it for the POC, but we will not sign off the use of this software without restrictions in place for normal usage.\"_ \n\nTheir concern is around the 'download as CSV/Excel' button in an apps Human Review and the corresponding API calls, which anyone who is part of a workspace can currently do. Presumably users are not able to download docs from the configuration stage of a Build project either (although I'm not sure whether hacking around the APIs you could do this)? My assumption is that this (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-823?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYTJjYTNhYzJhZWI1NGIyNzhkNmU0N2JkZDhlYzFlOTciLCJwIjoiaiJ9) feature may solve this, but I will need confirmation given their strict requirements. When is this due to be GA?\n\ncc @Nico @Tom @hannah",
