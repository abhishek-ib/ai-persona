      "message": "Hey everyone, there have been a lot of inquiries surrounding how to manage configs properly internally (especially now with our AI Hub environment). As you all know, the current method of *config management* was designed around *on-prem* customers and adapted to our internal environments, which makes how it currently works less than ideal, sometimes even complicated.\n\nJust wanted to spread awareness that there is a high priority project for Q2 on our team to redesign the way configurations are stored, managed, and applied through our internal environments, while keeping the configuration parity as much as possible between on-prem and internal/saas environments. This will make configuration management declarative, consistent, and reliable while moving the configurations to outside each individual tenant in a centralized location for more control.\n\nWe'll be sending out a docs soon and encourage people to take a look as configuration management will affect most teams. For any questions related to this project, feel free to reach out in <#C058UFAGWTF|>",
