      "message": "Hey all.. Yet another roll out to https://aihub.preview.instabase.com/. Things to note:\n1. This time we have relaxed the limitation a bit more so you will be able to process upto ~25 pages.\n    a. We have limited the page intake to 32K token\n    b. What does this mean? Any queries related to excluded pages(beyond the 32K token limit) will not be answered \n2. Performance limitations still remain the same, expect it to be slow when your document size is large.\n3. When you have multiple documents in a folder and you are using the \"All Document Mode\", only 3 docs are considered and the limitation of first 8K applies to these 3 docs individually. Recommendation is to keep your document count <= 3 in a single project and the size of these documents <7 pages.\nHope this helps. And more updates coming in this space. Have a great weekend!!",
