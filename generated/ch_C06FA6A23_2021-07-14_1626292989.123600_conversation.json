      "message": "Hi All, we are streamlining our Incident Response effort to make sure that the outages both internal and external are handled appropriately by:\n• Having a centralized communication channel to ensure that there is visibility into the status of the incident\n• Having an incident manager who is responsible for ensuring that proper teams are engaged and communication is handled correctly\n• Ensuring that we do retrospectives of the incidents so that we can learn from our mistakes and institute changes to prevent the same outage from happening again. \nWith this in mind we are:\n• Creating an Incident Response Guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQsGsA_ghGFdJIBwFbxHgaeyKSq1-4MzybdmPrm5-rI/edit): How would we respond when an incident is reported\n• Fortnightly Incident Review Meeting (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACXkpNuqzzXyKkEcWf9rcaiWU6PjMmxpBsucAQRMAMM/edit#) where we’ll talk about the outages in the previous 2 weeks.  The meeting will happen (Thursday 9:30-10:30 am PDT starting this week)\nOur first installment of the Review Meeting is tomorrow and we will be discussing the following 4 outages (details are already in the document):\n• 06/29: File System Outage In Prod\n• 07/06: Jenkins jobs consistently failing\n• 07/08: Natwest, Flows do not execute after upgrade\n• 07/10: FRB, NFS Disk is full\nIf you are interested in attending tomorrow’s meeting, please let me know and I’ll add you to the calendar invite.",
