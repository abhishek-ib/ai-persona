      "message": "What can we do to align the line numbers in the UI to the ones that the system error messages might reference?  As can be seen in the below screenshot, the error message cites line 6 as having the indentation problem, but the actual line with the problem is 3.  This makes it confusing to troubleshoot, especially for folks who are less technical.\n\nIt seems like there are probably 3 lines that we add the user written code to.  It'd probably be challenging to catch every potential compiler error and subtract 3 from their quoted line numbers.  It'd also look weird if we start the line numbers in the UI at 4 then count up from there...  So just brainstorming here: can we maybe display those 3 lines to the user and grey them out (to indicate that they're non-editable)?",
