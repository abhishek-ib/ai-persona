      "message": "I had uploaded four files to the Converse, and now I want to exclude one of them from a query I’m running.\nBy default all four are added to the context now, and I could not figure out how to remove one. I accidentally deleted one thinking the garbage bin icon would remove it from the context and not from the whole conversation.\n\nFinally I’ve found a roundabout way of doing “Limit message scope” to one file, and only then add the other two.\nCuriously then the “remove from scope” button appears, which I wanted there in the first place.\n\nCan we always have this option to quickly mark what’s in scope? Or maybe be able to drag between “Message scope” and “Other files” sections?",

The main reason I feel this is confusing is because toggling and limiting are different actions which isn't separated enough in the current design.\nCurrently it replaces toggle icon button with a limit action when all files are in scope. It'd be better if it's separated by instead either having a separate icon button for limiting, or having the limit action at the top and the context menu. Let's discuss this more in the sync",
