Currently, I'm having to paste this cleaning prompt into each field, which isn't terribly hard to do, but this feels like an easy win and not something we should make every customer do for such a common data type:\n> Clean this number to US dollar formatting (but no dollar sign), with 2 decimal places, no commas, and negative values are represented with a minus at the beginning instead of parenthesis.",

It seemingly wants to invent a decimal place 2 characters in and I can't think of a better way to clarify.\n\nThis doesn't feel like the experience we'd want external customers to deal with for what I would wager must be one of our most common data types.",

If there is a way to do this, I haven't found it.",
