So there are 2 issues with this:\n• Previous upgrade to overwrite the classifier script was only done in UAT env and was not pushed to Prod. Hence the document is getting classifed as `Other` class in Production\n• In UAT env, the document gets classified as `Document` class but we are not able to get the doc summary on this document (link: uat result (https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/hub/apps/6aecdc46-cb31-4fc3-b7c1-9e53e9e9159f/batch/e748845c-f09f-40a2-a265-f89ee445e2c9)). It could be because of the recent issues which we have seen because of the model upgrades. @Rafal is looking into this \ncc: @avi",
