      "message": "Hey all, I'm curious to hear your thoughts are on scheduling a team / org wide bug bash for 30 mins every 2 weeks for engineers to do UATs. I feel like this has a few benefits:\n1. If there is any confusion on how a feature is supposed to work, they can get answers right away instead of asynchronously. It's also easy for us to give feedback and discuss potential issues\n2. Natural scalability testing with multiple users on the platform at the same time\n3. Easy reminder for engineers to complete UATs and helps every engineer hold each other accountable for getting them done on time (there are other ways of doing this though)",
