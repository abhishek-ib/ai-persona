      "message": "Hi All,\nThe new OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) highlights the top 10 critical vulnerabilities in LLM applications, and should be considered a supplement to the original OWASP Top 10 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). OWASPâ€™s goal is to raise awareness of these vulnerabilities, suggest remediation strategies, and ultimately improve the security posture of LLM applications. Vulnerabilities include prompt injections, data leakage, and unauthorized code execution.\n\nAn OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications deck has been added to the Engineering training resources (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s7B7mczv-HaAQy2HGTm0so1kkYXHR_VGtWMms_y7TOI/edit?usp=drive_link), and a wiki page has been created here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/x/oICDiQ). Please take the time to become familiar with these vulnerabilities as part of your continuing security education.",
