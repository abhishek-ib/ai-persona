Wanted to announce that accuracy tests are now available (*internal preview)* on AI Hub Prod! To test it out, simply navigate to any app and click on “Accuracy tests” (see screenshot). From there you should be able to create a ground truth dataset (either using the project files or a new set of uploaded files) and then run accuracy tests against those ground truth sets.\n\nSince this feature is in internal preview for this release, there are a few known bugs that I’d also like to call out:\n• currently there are some issues with accessing ground truth sets across users/ in shared workspaces — for now we don’t recommend trying to share ground truth sets across users\n• In Human Review, when a document’s split is updated and saved, the ground truth set status might not be accurate\n• timestamps for a ground truth updated status are not always updated\n• ground truth snapshots (linked inside the accuracy report) are not always accurate\nPlease test this feature out and give us feedback (either here or in <#C06S4Q864LW|>)-- the team has worked super hard on this and would love to hear your thoughts! Huge shoutout to @pauline.comising @daniel @Jianqi Xing @hannah @Serena @lydia for all the work on this! :mario-highfive:",
