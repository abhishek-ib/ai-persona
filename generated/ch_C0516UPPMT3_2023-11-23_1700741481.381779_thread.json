      "message": "Hi Team, a prospect, Pivot (https://www.pivotapp.ai/), that looked into IB for invoice extraction (approx 10 fields) also tested Mindee (https://www.mindee.com/) (popular french invoice processing solution) and has decided to proceed with their services, as they saw marginally better performance in accuracy, but more importantly to their clients, lower latency in model response times: 1 sec per invoice on average. It's important to note that their approach isn't based on LLMs but rather a simple OCR with some additional capabilities built on top.",
