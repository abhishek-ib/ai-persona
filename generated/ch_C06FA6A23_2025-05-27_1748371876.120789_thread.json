It connects to Github, makes necessary changes and creates a branch. In my case, it updated the deps.bzl and go.mod, regenerated go.sum file.\nAll the changes happen in a VM, so you donâ€™t have to be around. Took about 1hr end-to-end.\nPR committed by Jules https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/70942",
