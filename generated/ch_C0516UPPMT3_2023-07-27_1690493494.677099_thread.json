      "message": "@jennifer I’ll have to take a look at Box Doc AI, & Snowflake Doc AI. Generally speaking the differentiators that we’ve communicated previously stack up. ie.\n\n1. We encode documents providing hints to the LLM to give more context and get better results.\n2. We’ve done work to support long documents and built this in a way that scales to support even the largest of docs.\n3. We have several techniques to prevent hallucinations\nThese are specific to LLMs, but all the work that we’ve done previously to support understanding documents applies as well. These are capabailities that require much more than passing information to an LLM. Like provenance tracking, productive human review, validations, etc.",
