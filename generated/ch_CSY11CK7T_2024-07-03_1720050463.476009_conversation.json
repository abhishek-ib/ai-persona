We pushed the home page re-design feature to GA without updating Cypress tests (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1719936840852499) caused these tests to fail: `view-home-page, send-product-feedback, aihub-templates, build-project-crud, billing, converse-app, converse-project-crud` failed due to this \n3.

Resetting review dashboard redux state (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1719948567204119?thread_ts=1719946793.168239&cid=CSY11CK7T). `review-manager-dashboard`, `review-reviewer-dashboard` failed due to this\n4. Our new Cypress CI sandbox (cypress-cyp) was updating every 4 hours compared to every 8 hours previously so this caused some failures due to timeouts\nChanges made:\n• Sean updated Cypress CI sandbox to re-deploy every 12 hours (5 am & 5 pm PST) (https://sandbox.console.instabase.com/customer/Engineering/tenant/crafting-cyp/info), so the sandbox should be stable during workdays\n• CJ turned on retries in aihub sandbox and uat\n• I skipped these tests this week: `field-editor, review-manager-dashboard, review-reviewer-dashboard` \nAction items:\n• Unskip `field-editor` : PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/59557) @Xindi Xu \n• Fix `review-manager-dashboard, review-reviewer-dashboard` : PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/59479) @Udit \n• Update these tests to use the new home page to navigate: `view-home-page, send-product-feedback, aihub-templates, build-project-crud, billing, converse-app, converse-project-crud`  @Weiming Wu \n• Consider triggering all Cypress tests on PRs that push a feature to GA: @Xindi Xu \n• Configure Doc Translation app (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1719591375848849) for the new Cypress org in aihub sandbox and uat for `view-app/billing` test @Aayush",
