      "message": ":party_jenkins: jenkins image update: we now have a multibranch pipeline to build jenkins image (aka our unit test image) every night for updating unit test running environment `JENKINS_IMAGE_TAG` in deploy.mk (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/shared-utils/build-utils/shared/deploy.mk#L25): https://prod.jenkins.instabase.com/job/tools/job/build-jenkins/ so the environment can continue to include most up to date dependency installations.\nif you want to test things out and build the image from your dev branch, just create a branch named `unittest-image-update-*` in instabase repo and the pipeline should pick it up in 5 minutes. you will need `jenkins-executor` role to start builds on prod jenkins, and you can get it by asking IT, or simply ask <!subteam^S038TM462UX> to help.\nwe are going to disable the existing jenkins image build job (https://jenkins.instabase.com/job/build-Jenkins/) in jenkins.instabase.com (http://jenkins.instabase.com) soon, if you have any questions please let us know in <#C035SLYCJ9X|>.\n\nthe wiki page (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INFRA/pages/90144813/Jenkins+at+Instabase) is also updated for this\n\nside note: we are also working on move this image away from jenkins base image as there is no reason why it has to be based on the jenkins image, it will be part of our CI improvement project by releng in Q2, so more changes to come in this area.",
