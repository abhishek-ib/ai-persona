      "message": "```\nHello Adam,\n\nOne of the changes between the June and September release was locking down whether or not a \"site-admin\" can view all orgs (and all of the repos within them). An environmental flag was added: `SITE_SETTING_SITE_ADMIN_CAN_ACCESS_ALL_ORGS`, defaulting to False, to control this behavior. This is what is preventing you from viewing the orgs the way you used to.\n\nThere are two different approaches to fix this for you:\n\n1) You can set that value to True in the yamls and redeploy to get the old behavior (if you do so, please let us know so we can set it that way for you going forward). While more convenient, this allows all site admins to see all data that's processed by Instabase, regardless of group, which may not fit with your preferred internal security model.\n\n2) You can add each user to each org as an admin, which will allow them to access all repos in that given org. While more secure by default, this is also more overhead.\n\nFor more information on what org admins can do, see https://instabase.com/docs/content/management/teams_and_orgs/orgs.html#org-admin-actions\n\nPlease let me know which course of action you take, so we can make sure to update our releases.\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid\n```\n\nDoes this look good? No lies?",
