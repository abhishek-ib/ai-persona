      "message": "Hey, playing a lot with the clean functionality today and the prompt clean is working great. Makes it so much easier to get the data I need which means its so much simpler to write the prompt as i’m not cluttering it with format info too.\n\nI do have some feedback on the ‘quick clean date’ functionality, which feels like its the code for the UDF `format_date` from Enterprise. Is that the case? I think it would be more powerful if I didn’t have to provide the input month order to this function and the LLM could interpret this using context of the document. I’ve tested this with customers before where I ask the LLM to determine the data order, and it seems to use other cues like the addresses and currency to determine if its a US document or not and apply the correct month order.\n\nAt the moment with the current implementation I can’t use the built in formatting with MUFG’s solution as there are some docs which are month first, and some which are day first all in the same solution.\n\nAs an improvement, could we add a 3rd option to the input option which is ‘Auto’ where we let the LLM decide? This would make the feature much more powerful.",

      "message": "That’s correct, this function uses `format_date`  from the platform so it does not use the LLM. I’m adding an option to the input argument for “infer date” but it won’t handle 1) cases where context is needed i.e. addresses/currency or 2) cases where the date is in a sentence like your first screenshot. In this case it would be better to use a prompt clean, which is not clear.\nI think it might be good to mention that this function/the quick clean functions *don’t* use the LLM cc: @melissa.amos",
