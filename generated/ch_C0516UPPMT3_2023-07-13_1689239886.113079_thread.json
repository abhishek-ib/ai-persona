      "message": "Recently, a very common customer request is `extracting a phrase or paragraph from a given document and then comparing or matching it semantically against a set of phrases, categories, or other documents in a separate document or database.`\n\nFrom what I understand, this task would involve creating embeddings not only for the extracted document but also for the phrases, categories, or other documents we want to match against.\n\nI will create a PFR for this but I wanted to check if we have already discussed this or if there might be a workaround to accomplish this task currently. It seems like having this capability could provide a significant advantage in several upcoming PoVs.",
