      "message": "Hi team,\nIs it expected that while building an app, the output directory and the ibflowresults/ibflowbin files etc. are created in the same storage as where the files are imported from?\nI created a new Build project and imported a directory from my Instabase Google Drive. When I clicked on the “Preview App” button, it created an `output` directory with a bunch of stuff inside it in the Google Drive folder. I would imagine we don’t want to create these flow binary files and other files in the users’ cloud storage; we only want to use them as input sources?",
