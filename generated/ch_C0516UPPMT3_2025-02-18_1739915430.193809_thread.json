We can re-open this but but also I'd want to qualify how big of a pain point this is before we consider prioritizing this.",

Yes, Kering mentioned about 1000 fields.\nTBH, i think the request was more like a super exotic request and was more to understand if we can do that or not.\n\nIf needed, I can follow up with Kering to understand if\n1. this request will occur multiple time or if its a 1 time\n2. little bit more about the use case and why they have 1000 fields",
