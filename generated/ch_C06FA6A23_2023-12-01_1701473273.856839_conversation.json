      "message": "*SaaS Research Series - AXA DA*\n\nAXA DA's feedback with Instabase SaaS has also been mostly positive. They covered a range of areas for feedback across Instabase, not limited to SaaS. They seemed eager to give feedback, having collected feedback from colleagues who couldn’t attend the call and asking to provide more feedback in a written format after the call.\n*TL;DR* - AXA DA covered several areas, especially around model training, since the main admin is also a data scientist. The highlights are:\n• More data / metrics produced during solution building (e.g. OCR details, model training field metrics\n• See more details from each model training epoch (AXA DA is happy with our fine-tuned models)\n• Solution migration - moving models is the hardest part\n• Flow review - filtering on filename\nThe feedback session was part of their regular AXA DA & Instabase standup - so I got a peek into what this is like for customers. They celebrated milestones in new versions of solutions, and also identified how the automation rate of a solution was improving compared to their goal. Because this was in\n\n*Model Training*\n• Overall - good experience with training models\n• Would like to see more info about test record metrics\n    ◦ If there are 4 fields, can’t see which error is on which field, want to be able to filter test records based on field\n• Annotation sets are not versioned\n    ◦ When a model is upgraded and an annotation set is modified, there is no history of the old annotation set\n    ◦ E.g. Delete a record from annotation set on newest version of a model causes the record to be removed from old versions of the model as well\n• Model performance is good, and are happy with the pre-trained/fine-tuned models form IB\n    ◦ No complaints about model training time, feels that this depends on annotation set complexity\n    ◦ AXA DA is unsure if they are overfitting the model and need to download the logs to see the status of each epoch. Would like to see logs per epoch in the ML Studio UI\n*Other*\n• Getting data out of OCR logs are difficult  - the CSV that is produced contains JSON that needs to be parsed again\n• Want documentation about functions available to use in scripts, similar to the documentation about refiner functions (which is helpful).\n• Flow review - want to filter by filename. Currently have to find the time a document was processed in order to find it.\n    ◦ AXA DA’s requirement is to filter by policy #, which is always present in the filename\n*Solution Migration*\n• Currently downloading everything and uploading again (like all our other customers)\n• AXA DA has heard about a feature coming to move things between environments\n    ◦ Note - we haven’t started work on this yet\n• Desired behavior: want DEV, UAT, PROD to be connected and can choose where (in the filesystem of another deployment) to send a solution/model to\n• Want to keep Marketplace Admin distinct between environments - DEV/UAT publish models more frequently to test new versions\n*Admin*\n• Have not heard of ICC yet\n    ◦ Had time for a quick demo - didn’t touch on feedback, or secrets\n• Current admin manages users, user permissions, and flow reviewers\n• Asked to be able to prevent reviewers from uploading/downloading files\nOriginal notes here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hmeA-D9Z8BJaNCRpEeVdQf6U20CTmwn8Ntxf0neoGzU/edit).",
