      "message": "Update here: api-server-app unit tests are still crazy verbose with the -b change. I’m still not entirely sure why the logs get through — it seems to happen only if I run all the tests with discover, but doesn’t happen if i run only a single test, even if that test contains the verbose stuff.\n\nAnyways, I realized the reason we have all these stat errors is the FakeIOFileService is essentially designed (I don’t know if intentionally) to have a failed stat when it’s initialized. I’m creating a PR to remove the log message, since I don’t think FileNotFoundError raised by os.stat is an exception - seems like expected behavior if the file is not there. That greatly reduces the amount of error logs in api-server-apps unit tests!\n\nNow still need to figure out why all those other log messages are still coming through :thinking_face:",
