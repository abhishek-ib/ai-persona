I’ll do 2 tasks:\n• Change names of Postman calls so they’re the same as the names we use in `openapi.yaml` and the docs\n• Change the order of the Postman calls so they mirror the order used in the docs (the consistency will make things easier for users to find, even though I can understand why Postman currently does things like carving off some of the operations into an “Advanced” section that the docs don’t have.",
