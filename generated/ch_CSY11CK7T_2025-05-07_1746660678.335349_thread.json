I noticed that most (if not all) of them seem to be failing due to things unrelated to my changes. Reading the recent messages in this channel, it seems like we have had issues with cypress tests recently. What do people usually do in such a situation? Is there a way to bypass the Cypress tests in the CI after confirming that they are failing due to unrelated reasons? Or do people merge manually?",
