If I were using Converse to summarize something or pull out key information, I might want to be able to then easily copy that response and paste it into an email or something.\n\nThe ability to download a conversation might also be helpful. Maybe if I want to clear the conversation but still hold onto the responses, or want to be able to quickly reference/share responses without needing to reopen AI Hub.",
