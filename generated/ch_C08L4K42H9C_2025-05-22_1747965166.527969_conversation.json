      "message": "Hey Automate Team - Some of you may have heard, but I wanted to formally share some bittersweet news. I'll be leaving Instabase June 3rd. I've absolutely loved working with all of you, and I'm incredibly proud of everything we've built with AI Hub. Our current product is the strongest we've ever had in IB history, and none of it would be possible without the tireless work across this team. You have all demonstrated incredible resilience, resourcefulness, and a \"healthy disregard for the impossible\" over the last 2 years as we rebuilt from scratch. I can't wait to see the continued growth and success. I'll be around until my last day. If you want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out!",
