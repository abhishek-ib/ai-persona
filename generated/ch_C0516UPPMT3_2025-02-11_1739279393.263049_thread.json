      "message": "Hey team, I've received some high-level questions from the ANZ CTO based on two articles (with contrasting viewpoints) that have created quite a bit of discussion internally. The email thread where he explains why he likes Instabase is interesting (I've summarised this below), but they'd also like to get some thoughts on how we plan to keep up with new tech advancements.\n1. https://www.runpulse.com/blog/why-llms-suck-at-ocr\n2. https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/gemini-flash-2\n*Why Instabase*\n1. \"This is one of the reasons why we need(ed) to shut down the cottage industry of various engineering teams exploring using their own roll-your-own LLMs. It’s really easy to do amazing things, but there’s a ceiling of disappointment once you get into the harder problem spaces.\"\n2. \"This is why I like Instabase so much: it’s not a team that happened to get into Document Ingestion; they’ve been doing this for 8 years with MIT founders who understand the nuance of documents.\"\n3. \"The LLM is hyper-enabling Instabase's architecture, but fundamentally their differentiating aspect is being an expert in document ingestion. The one line in the blog can sum it up so neatly: *Data ingestion is a multistep pipeline*\"\n*Questions*\n1. Does instabase see a time when the LLM can replace the digitisation and pre-processing phases? \n2. Do you perform regular internal benchmarking on this where results can be shared with ANZ?\ncc @Anant @Clemens @bharath.raj @Jasper @junie.dinda @Tom",
