You can start by checking if we can successfully pull the URL by uploading the URL into Converse (you'll see an option to add a doc by URL).\n\nAssuming that works, we can discuss how to leverage this in a solution. Unfortunately URL upload isn't available via API yet but maybe it could be used as an advanced app. cc: @Aayush",
