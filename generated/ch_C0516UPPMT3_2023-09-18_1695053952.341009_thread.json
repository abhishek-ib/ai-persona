      "message": "Hello! I'm working on docs for Build schema, and I'm finding this modal challenging to document. This typically indicates to me that the UX could be improved. (This is based on sandbox testing this a.m.)\n\nThe sticking point: there is no separate mechanism to add fields to the *Create fields* list, vs. to actually create the fields. If I type a field name and click *Create*, it doesn't actually create the field, but only adds it to the *Create fields* list. If I type a _second_ field name and click *Create*, it closes the modal and creates the fields. So, the behavior of the *Create* button is inconsistent.\n\nI'd suggest adding a second, *Add field* button below the text box, to be used to add a typed field to the *Create fields* list. And then ensure that the *Create* button always closes the modal and creates the fields.",

So the inconsistent behavior of the *Create* button is a bug.\n\nI do still think we should consider adding a button that allows you to add a typed field to the *Create fields* list. If the aforementioned bug is fixed, there will be no way to add a typed field apart from pressing Enter/Return. Many users will instead click *Create* which will dump them out of the modal possibly before they're done adding fields.",
