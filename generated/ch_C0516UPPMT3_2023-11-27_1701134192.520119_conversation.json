      "message": "Hey everyone! We're planning to launch shared workspaces and shared build projects on AI Hub in 23.47 for AI Hub commercial. This will be our first step to enabling collaboration for our commercial organizations. This feature is available on sandbox/UAT to test - we'd love your feedback!\n\n:house_buildings: *What are workspaces?*\nA workspace is designed to contain the following assets. Shared workspaces are designed to allow multiple users to access these shared assets.\n• Projects\n• Conversations\n• App Runs\n• Storage\nA workspace provides complete user and data isolation, so the assets remain private to only the workspace members and there is no cross sharing of data across workspaces.\n\n:bulb: *Why are we launching workspaces?*\nBased on customer feedback, there are a few use cases for shared workspaces including:\n• A shared space for a team to work and share assets (ex: sE workspace, saleseng workspace, etc.)\n• A shared space to build a project for a specific use case (ex: KYC workspace, trade finance workspace, etc.)\n• A way to segment AI Hub into different environments (ex: PROD workspace, DEV workspace, UAT workspace) - this is particularly important as we will only be providing one deployment)\n• A way for an organization to separate across clients (ex: each customer for a partner gets a workspace)\n:launch-rocket: *What is launching in 23.49?*\n• Org admins can create new shared workspaces through account settings in the workspace tab; by default all admins are in all workspaces\n• Org admins can assign workspace managers who can manage workspace members in the workspace tab (along with admins)\n• You can access all workspaces you are a member of in My Hub\n• Only projects, app runs and storage can be in a shared workspace to start (conversations may come later)\n• All users that have access to the shared workspace will have edit access to the project (there are no fine grained access controls at project level)\n• When more than one person is trying to access a shared project, there is a locking mechanism that allows only one person to edit the project at a time. This is designed to prevent overwrites and minimize data loss. Over time we'll work to get to closer real-time collaboration\n• You can navigate across workspaces in Build by switching workspaces in the left hand nav\nHuge thanks to platform team (@Xindi Xu @William Helmrath @Weiming Wu @Heymian), build team (@naveen @Paul H @Eric Han @Bastiane), designers/docs team (@Siya @alagu @Rosie) and many others for the close collaboration to make this happen!  Excited for your feedback. Please give it a try in sandbox and UAT environments!",
