I think we only show a modal if the selected doc's class changes, maybe we can add a toast once all docs are classified? cc @Natasha",

Agreed that with 3 documents the scrolling pattern won't help.\n\nWhat you're proposing is a pattern we see with gmail/slack where user needs to click on the email or thread/channel to dismiss the visual indication. I did consider this and my initial thought was that it is an overkill to make the user select each document for the indicator to go away, and if they don't the UI stays very busy especially in table and thumbnail views.\n\nLet's wait to hear from Bastiane and potentially get more feedback before we make this decision.",
