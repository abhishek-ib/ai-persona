Do we have plans to allow users to customise which metrics are shown here?\n2. How can customers create their own metrics? \n    a. What is the current process for them to do this e.g. bulk download of raw data vs partially processed metrics?\n    b. Can we make it easier for customers to generate insights?\n    c. Can we allow customers to route the output of their own analyses to appear in the dashboard?\ncc @jack.robbins",

      "message": "Hey Hamish, its a very reasonable request. We don't have any near-term plans for further customization of the dashboard, though we have a backlog item to add additional time windows. Did they mention any specifics about their use-cases & what metrics they'd want to add?\n\nBulk download could be a workaround depending on what they're planning to do, but its still a layer removed from the raw data. There are APIs that expose this information from IB platform, but they haven't yet been cleaned up for direct use from AI Hub. That would probably be the fastest path to unblock access to the raw data.",
