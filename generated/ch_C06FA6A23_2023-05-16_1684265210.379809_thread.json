      "message": "Hey team,\n\nWe are planning to deprecate the usage of TensorFlow in model-training and model-service.\n\nAfter consulting with the model-dev team (@Rafal @SÅ‚awek Biel @Bartosz Topolski @Nikolaos Kofinas), we have confirmed that no models are currently being trained using TensorFlow. Additionally, we checked the signature, bank statement, and sentence similarity models in the marketplace admin, and none of them rely on TensorFlow either.\nConsidering recent developments, TensorFlow has announced that they will no longer support Python 3.7, not even for vulnerability updates (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/60176) (cc @shaunak). In light of this, we have decided to deprecate the TensorFlow dependency from our model-training and model-service code base as it will be difficult to maintain in the future.\n\nIf you foresee any potential issues or have any concerns, please let us know as soon as possible. We want to ensure a smooth transition and address any challenges proactively. Thanks!\ncc @Heymian @lydia",
