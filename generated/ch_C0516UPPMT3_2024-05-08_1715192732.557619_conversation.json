      "message": "*Pricing Update!*\nStarting in 24.18 (planned to GA 5/13), we have two pricing updates to be aware of:\n• *Classification:* Users will start to be charged for classification and split classification.  Classification is counted as an additional field in your schema and is charged at the same field rate (based on length of document classified). This change was announced as part of 24.14 release notes and you can find more details and examples in the documentation here (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/aihub/policies/pricing-policy/index.html#2418-pricing-update).  For our commercial customers, this change will be effective starting their first billing cycle post 5/13 (cc: @Tom @Lee)\n• *Chatbots:* Usage for chatbots was previously being included in Converse usage. Chatbots will now be a separate source, so you can refer to this usage separately. \nThanks @Victor Zeng for all the work implementing this and @Rosiefor your docs magic! If there are any questions, please reply in thread.",
