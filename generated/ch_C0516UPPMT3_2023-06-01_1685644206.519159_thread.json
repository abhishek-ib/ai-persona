      "message": "Hi Team,\n\nI did the good 'ol \"Partner Test\" and had my girlfriend try the beta AI Hub with minimal coaching.   I figured it would be a good test as to what we can expect when a \"standard user\" tries the platform post go-live.   I tried to pick a document that would be a good candidate: A Wells Fargo bank statement that was 5 pages,  but where the transaction history didn't span more than 2 pages.\n\nThings started off positively: Basic questions she asked like \"_What is this document_\", \"_What is the account number_\", and \"_How much interest did this account earn so far this year?_\" all returned great results.  *Correct!* :white_check_mark:\n\nThings got more tricky when she started to interrogate the transaction history.  \"_List all the deposits for the month_\" returned a random subset of some of the transactions.   *Fail* :x:\n\nI coached her to be more specific and to use the column names and headings: \"_What was the largest withdrawal/subtraction in the transaction history section?_\"   *Correct!*  :white_check_mark:\n\nBut unfortunately, things went downhill from here.  \"_List out all of the \"Withdrawals/Subtractions\" from the \"Transaction History\" section_\" resulted in a misleading list of integers, many of which weren't even in the Transaction History section.  *Fail.*  :x:\n\nTrying to be more specific:  \"_List out all of the \"Withdrawals/Subtractions\" from the \"Transaction History\" section as a table_\" caused a table with a series of hallucinations that weren't even in the document, including the addition of transaction dates that didn't exist in the document, either.  *Fail*  :x:\n\nTaking a queue from *Matt Weaver*, I put my prompt engineering hat on and tried to get more specific: \"_\"deposits\", \"money in\", \"additions\" all mean the same thing. Looking only at the \"transaction history\" section of the document, what was the largest transaction depositing money into this account?_\"  This time, it pulled the total sum of deposits from the summary page instead of looking for the largest single item in the Transaction History table.  *Fail* :x:\n\nFinally, my girlfriend noted one of the transactions involved cashing a check (cheque for my Canadian and EMEAR friends).   She asked: \"_Were there any checks written?_\"  -- AI Hub correctly responded:  \"Yes, there were checks written. The statement includes a summary of checks written and a transaction history that lists checks.\"  *Pass* :white_check_mark:\n\nHowever, when she then asked: \"_What is the list of checks in the transaction history?\"_ AI Hub responded with \"The list of checks in the transaction history is not provided in the given text.\"  *Fail*  :x:\n\n*Summary:* When I asked my partner to describe the experience: \"I don't think this is ready to deal with a  bank statement yet.  An every day person is not going to know how to write complex prompts without more guidance from the solution\".\n\nI can redact the bank statement and share if it would be helpful.",
