I could try something like this but there’s a few caveats:\n• the gradient needs to be large enough to reach content that isn’t just the bg color (since each option has padding) and small enough to not cover everything\n• some popups allow custom content where scrolling is added outside of pollen within the popup, so I can’t easily detect scroll position.",
