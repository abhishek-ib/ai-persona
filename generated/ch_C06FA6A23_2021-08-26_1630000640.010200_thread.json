      "message": "Hi all, I have observed quite a few error reports sent by GCP in emails indicating runtime errors happening on our platform. I looked through them and most of them indicate real issues and bugs, for example `IndexError: list index out of range` in python. I am curious if we are treating these reports seriously and do we have a proper protocol to Jira them and root-cause them and fix them? To me this is quite a crucial matter because whatever problems that happen in our prod, we have full access to logs and pods and we should be able to debug and fix them. The worst thing that can happen to us is that we become numb to these errors and things start acting up in our customer's env. Thoughts?",
