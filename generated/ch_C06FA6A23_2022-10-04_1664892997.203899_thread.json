      "message": "Here’s a visual example. This is a mount we use for Wells Fargo. We are using the ib-e-wellfargo space, not the default one. It’s confusing that the default one shows up, and ideally would not be present.\n\nThe two spaces are mirrors, but we can’t use _Instabase Drive_ because we also cross mount this to other envs. We cross mount to other environments sort of as a staging setup. The absolute path references in project files get broken if someone accesses files using the default _Instabase Drive_ name.\n\nAdding this context here because I worry about Solution Builder breaking this use case for us, so trying to raise some visibility as we make progress on abstracting the fs.",
