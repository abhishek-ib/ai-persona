      "message": "<!here> Hi all, pre-submit checks are getting better!\n\nHere’s the first pass at this: https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/9624\n\nWhat does this mean for you right now?\n  1. Make sure pre-commit is installed in your repo (brew install pre-commit && pre-commit install)\n  1. pip install gitpython==2.1.11\n    - You’ll need to make sure that gitpython is available in all of your tabs. Reason is: when you run “git commit”, it run Instabase specific checks which require the “gitpython” library\n  2. cd into the toplevel instabase directory, then run “make init”\n       - make init in the “instabase” top level directory sets up the correct git pre-submit hooks\n   3.  More pre-submit checks are coming! Specifically we’re speeding up the Python build so that .proto gen doesn’t take as long\n\nPlease make requests for what other pre-submit checks you’d like to see by adding a text and a comment to this doc! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2-mLTV91kU6rrfn7Jzm3RgEnv6SSDEjBzCAyEMqjiE/edit",
