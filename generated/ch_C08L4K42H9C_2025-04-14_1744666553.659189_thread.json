I got this ticket for upgrading a package and was trying to following these instructions (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/2102689795/Third+Party+Package+Management). However, it seems the instructions are not applicable since I'm not upgrading a library but rather something native to linux. Could someone point me in the right direction for this?",
