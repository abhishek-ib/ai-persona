      "message": "Hey folks - during this konmari week some of us are looking to delete the legacy configs i.e. `<service>/deployment/kubernetes` . We will leave out the files needed for running services locally. Does anyone see concerns to this? We discussed internally within the team and did not see concerns, and wanted to understand if there are any dependencies to it.\n\nThese files were used earlier before DM based configs were introduced, and were kept for some customers who still took in legacy releases. From customer pov, all of them now receive release bundles which are based off the new configs in `deployment-configs/` , so should not impact them afa we are aware.",
