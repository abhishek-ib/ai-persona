      "message": "Some initial experiments after changing the ibocr format to using IBML format spec:\n1. For smaller size document ~(10s KBs), the reduction is about 60 - 70% in the ibdoc produced by IBML format as opposed to IBOCR format (5 v/s 14 KB, 450 v/s 1700 KB)\n2. For larger size documents ~(10s MBs), the reduction is about 80+% (7.3 v/s 53.5 MB)\n\nThis is without any additional optimizations such as compression, reusing common paths etc., which are easier to make with us owning the format, and exposing the JSON through the APIs.",
