      "message": "Hi all! — some exciting updates on our eng-wide CI/CD efforts (in the pursuit of continuous testing so you never have to manually run UAT again):\n1. You can now use the Golden test framework to verify Flow behavior: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqMW_9rt34othaUTTiYFSRjJxfJleWgZES-wEH5UsHI/edit. We’ve currently automated 38 UATs with this framework! I believe you can now validate nearly any set of Flow actions using this framework. I’ve provided helper videos for getting started in the document\n2. You can use the System test setup to verify any API (whether using cookie or api-token based auth): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abIC5dqt_YET4szxEh6pjd83DA2LIRNEypZGDleWtQ0/edit#heading=h.p8anus1zbc8x. We’ve only automated 1 UAT this way — but we anticipate that any arbitrary API or POST request you have can be validated using this setup.\nThanks @Karthik S for leading the effort on the Golden test framework, @Jonathan Shih for writing over 10 UATs with the golden framework and @Heymian @will (+others) for making dogfood push continuously every 2 hours!\n\nWith GhostInspector coming on-board, we’ll be able to run a battery of 100's of UATs every 2 hours if we combine GhostInspector, unit-tests, regression-tests, and system tests.\n\nThis should dramatically speed up our UAT process, as well as ensure that we continuously test a wide-swath of Instabase behavior more frequently!\n\ncc: @Chetan @lydia @Aaron Vontell @Erick @shaunak @Ashish @Aaron Vontell @Kerry @Aaron Tami and others who I think will benefit from converting their manual UATs using these frameworks.",
