A way we can take the last iteration of an application and place it in legacy app’s so customers who may use it still can but know that it is no longer supported??",

Our naming conventions and consolidation or breaking apart applications will only serve the customers for increased productivity. Our goal is always to improve our product and user experience. We have an app list below but that is subject to change but the features and functionality of the overall platform will not. Some applications are subject to change but overall experience will only improve. \n*Beta Applications:*\nAs a platform that is increasing capabilities we will continue to create beta applications. Those beta applications (apps) are subject to change based on testing. Some apps will be deprecated, feature sets will change, and some will move to production. Our goal is to always provide an experience that will meet customers needs. We can never guarantee that a beta app will provide the same functionality as when it was created. \n*Deprecation of Applications:*\nThe same technology decisions made a year ago will not be the same technology decisions we make today. Some applications based on usage and the evolving landscape will ultimately be deemed unsupported. In the event that an application is unsupported we will give a 6-month notice before deprecating the application. That application will move to the deprecated category.",
