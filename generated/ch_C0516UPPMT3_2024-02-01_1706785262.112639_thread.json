We also have, as @Gwen says, `URL_BASE` which refers to\n`https://aihub.instabase.com/api` .\n\nClearly, it’s very easy to confuse URL_BASE with the base URL---who would even guess those were different URLs? So we standardized  `https://aihub.instabase.com` as API_ROOT, and `https://aihub.instabase.com/api` as the base URL.\n\nIf it’s still confusing---and it sounds like it might be---we’re very happy to make further changes. @Gwen, @Lee, do you have any suggestions? These two URLs are differentiated throughout the API docs, probably because those were written by a lot of different people who were just doing their best but weren’t aligned on terminology. Is there a legitimate need for both? Is there better terminology we could be using?",
