Here's last week usage in numbers* :chart: \nAIHub Metrics Update - 5/21 to 5/27 - Google Slides (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FRPsgyGExygqK_E8ZLVpTVvRphqguICs8bJ1Kqauya0/edit#slide=id.p)\n• 163 unique users visited AI Hub, 158 used the converse app, and 51 used build.\n• 42 users created converse app projects, and asked a total of 3174 converse queries.\n• Among AIHub apps, the doc summary app was the most popular and users ran 20 batches on it.\n• Overall, we consumed 127m tokens on gpt3.5 (default model), and 847k tokens on gpt4 (advanced model). From a rough calculation on OpenAI pricing (https://openai.com/pricing), if my math is right, it seems like this is about $254+$42.35 = $296. Not a bad ROI?\nKeep selfhosting AIHub, your feedback is invaluable to polishing the product :rocket:",

We want to abstract away the model information from users for various reasons: \n• we will start integrating with various model providers and integrate more models. Unlike developers, most non technical users dont care about the actual model used. We need to think more about this when we expose APIs to developers. \n• For pricing, it is better to not share the actual models being used to retain flexibility",
