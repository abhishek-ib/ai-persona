      "message": "A lot of insurance claims have pictures - damage on a home, drawing of a car accident, picture of a damaged car etc. With GPT4o, it would be really cool, as part of a single flow to extract a visual entity like that, and then able to query it. A common car insurance claim have people both draw and explain a car accident situation. If the model can explain the drawing, we could also compare the drawing with the written explanation and make inferences whether these match / make sense.",
