      "message": "hi @hannah,\n\nPlease check all the comments, I have made the changes.\nPassport:\n• \t\tThe app name needs to be changed to \"Passport\" to be consistent with the other apps on the marketplace - *done*\n• \t\tThe description needs to be more readable. I'd recommend:\n• \t\t\"Extract information from any passport\"-*okay*\n• \t\tTo confirm - are all passports supported? Or just US? If there are country limitations we should include in the description. - *I'll add the countries that we have tested the app on.* \n• \t\tWe don't need to list all fields - this can be found by clicking \"App Info\" and looking at the schema. - *okay*\n• \t\tThe app icon needs to be a colorful icon and match the other icons for apps published to the marketplace - *done*\n• \t\tThis app was published by *Smile Garg.* We need to recreate this app from the Instabase pubishing account so that the name displays as \"by Instabase\" when published to the marketplace - *how can we do that*\n• The application worked well, but the MRZ didn't extract great. I don't think this is a blocker for publishing, but we should look into how we might improve this. *okay*\n• \t\tCan we move the build project to a shared workspace? I don't have access to the project and wanted to take a look at the MRZ prompt - *it’s already in shared workspace, Link: https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/build/a4676a76-a340-40eb-9d33-d9f4603132e9*\n• \t\tGoing forward all build projects for these marketplace apps should be in a shared workspace - *it’s already in shared space.*\n\nUS Drivers License:\n• \t\tSimilar feedback here:\n• \t\tThe description needs to change to be just \"Extract information from any US Drivers License\". We can remove all information about the schema. *Okay*\n• \t\tThe app icon needs to be added and colorful just like the others *done*\n• \t\tWe need to publish from the Instabase account *how can we do that*\n• \t\tThe project needs to be in a shared workspace so that it is accessible for other IB teams - *it’s already in shared space.*\n• \t\tWe need to add sample files before publishing - *How can I do that?*\n• \t\tFor testing, I pulled the first sample drivers license off of the web and realized that we extracted the name wrong and we didn't get the gender. For anyone testing this app (who will likely do the same with the same test drivers license), it does not instill much confidence. Can we take a look at this? *- sure, please share the sample*",
