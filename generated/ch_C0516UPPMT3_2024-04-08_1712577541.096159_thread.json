      "message": "Hey, i’m giving prompt validations a try. Overall this is really helpful I can see this becoming the default way that I make validation functions going forwards!\n\nA few pieces of feedback:\n\n1. When prompting, can we highlight the input fields differently? At the moment they just appear as text, it would be good for these to be highlighted to show they are a variable input. Something like the pills design, or a different colour. \n    a. The prompt input box also has smaller text size than the prompt inputs for extraction and cleaning - is that intentional?\n2. The summary box is helpful. But the formatting and design could be improved to make it easier to parse. Are there plans to change the designs of the :param <param-name> designs? \n3. I have some line returns in the summary text that probably shouldn’t be there. \n4. The summary mentions kwargs as an input, but that isn’t one of the params in the function. \n5. The code generated looks pretty good, but when its run it doesn’t actually work. I think this is because its using a variable called `invoice_number` when the input param is `Invoice Number` - this is proven when I add the document as a test case and I get the correct result. \n6. Its only possible to copy all of the code. It would be useful to be able to ‘convert’ this to a custom function so that I can make manual edits. \n7. I would prefer if you could copy sections of the code vs only being able to copy the whole thing. \n8. The examples generated look good and return the correct results. However I think the design of the list could be improved to improve usability. \n    a. At the moment the names are ‘Example n’  - this isn’t that helpful for me, I don’t know when them being numbered would be helpful\n    b. The subtitle with the test case description is good. I’d put this in the main title instead of ‘Example n’\n    c. You need to edit the example to see what the field value is. It would be good to see this in the list view too. At the moment I need to edit each one to check I agree with the test cases. \n9. I’d like to be able to see the text that is returned when the rule fails. At the moment I can only see Pass / Fail, but i’d like to see the full comment returned too.",
