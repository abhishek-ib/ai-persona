Looking through my notes and catching up with the team, it seems the latency comes from the following:\n• “Sometimes it takes 15+ minutes to upload documents into Converse; we tested this on documents of 20-140 pages”\n• “It additionally previously took more than this when we asked a question at Converse; we found the latency to be better in Build but they come with different answers”",
