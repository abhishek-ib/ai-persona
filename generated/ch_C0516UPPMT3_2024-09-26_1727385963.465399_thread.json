Additionally, it shows a `Group` that's part of the workspace (\"Automation Group 1\") which is a `Member` role in the workspace (ie not a `Manager` nor `Admin`).\n\n*Screenshot 2* shows hovering over the `Reviewer` assigned to the first document/run record in the table. Specifically, it shows the ability to assign a review. I'll click into this for the next screenshot.\n\n*Screenshot 3* shows the reviewer picker/assigner pop-up.\n\n*Screenshot 4* shows selectable reviewers.\n\n*Screenshots 5 & 6* show I can't assign `Managers` nor `Admins` as reviewers\n• I can only choose `members` as reviewers, but not `Managers` nor `Admins`\n• I can understand why review tasks are assigned to `members` only by default, but I feel like it might be helpful to allow end-users to opt-in to being able to assign other roles as reviewers (maybe there can be controls/permissions around this.) \n:fast_forward:  *TL;DR:*\nIt may be helpful to be able to assign `Managers` and `Admins` as human reviewers instead of just `Members`.\n\n:memo: _*Side note:* Oops, I meant to send this as a separate message, but alas, added it to this thread as a reply_ :lil_nervous:",

The behavior you're seeing for review reassignment doesn't have to do with being a part of a group or your role - it's because of the _specific_ group that those users you see listed are a part of. That document is in a review queue, so you can only select members of the group that are assigned to that review queue. Maybe we could add some copy about where those options for assignees are coming from? i.e., \"showing eligible review queue group members\"",
