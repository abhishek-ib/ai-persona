I think my sandbox got rebuilt today and I noticed a few packages vanished (there are not in my homedir so my snapshot didn't have it). This has happened a few times already. Can I request some libraries be added to the base image? Or is there a way I can layer something on top? Specifically, I want `tmux` and `emacs`.",
