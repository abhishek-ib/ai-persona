      "message": "hey team - wanted to share some updates here on usage of log4j in monitoring/elasticsearch -\n• Monitoring images: all the images are golang based and do not use log4j. Out of precaution, we have scanned these images and confirmed that this vulnerability does not exist.\n• Elasticsearch: while many of the customers use internal hosted ES instance/image - some customers receive ES image from us. We have gone ahead to apply recommended JVM option (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/23377) to disable the usage of log4j lookup to address . This can be done through update to the yaml. (At a later point,  we will rebuild our images using new base images from Elastic community which includes this change/updated version of log4j2.)",

We can say something along the following lines -\n\n> IB has looked into the images shipped for the newly reported log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 (https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html?source=:em:eo:ie:cpo:::RC_WWMK210714P00017:SEV400208211) and see `Elasticsearch` image to be impacted. We will like to apply the included patch here to ensure that the vulnerability cannot be exploited. We are also awaiting elastic community on getting an updated image that does not include vulnerable component and will ship once available. Thanks",
