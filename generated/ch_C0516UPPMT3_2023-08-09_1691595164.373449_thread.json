Is this permanent?  Is there a way around this?  It used to be a major differentiator that we had no page limits.\n\nWhen we change or add limitations to the app, can we please get those captured in release notes?  Even if the notes are internal, *it is critical that we get into the habit of creating detailed documentation and change logs* (could even be bullet points like we get in iphone app updates).\n\ncc. @Léo",
