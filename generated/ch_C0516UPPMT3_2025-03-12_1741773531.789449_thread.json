      "message": "Tom and Roger Walton (CRO) had a regular 1:1 before Xmas and an action from that was for ResAI and IB to showcase each others latest tech to ensure we are all up to speed with each others latest product offering. Tom asked me to work with Jan Syrinek (Head of Product) to set this up - we've been in contact but need to agree a date for the showcase.\nThe reason for me asking for an update on the integration was down to timings. If we are near to having an integration ready, we could align this showcase with the \"launch\" of the integration to our teams. If the integration is a little way off, we proceed with the showcase for now and come back to the integration \"launch\" later.\nI will look to have @Brian@david.lee & @hannah on the showcase, as well as our GTM LT.",
