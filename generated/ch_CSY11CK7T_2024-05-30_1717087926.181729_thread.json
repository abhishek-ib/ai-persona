      "message": "I have a new controversial opinion about cypress tests and I'm curious what people think... I'm finding that it's much easier to use strings for test ids than try to make constants! My reasoning:\n1. Making them into constants just creates more overhead of adding them to a constants file somewhere and importing them in both places\n2. If you're inspecting the dom, you have to find the test id, search for it in the code base to find the constant, and then search for the constant to find the actual code - one step more than if you're using strings\n3. When we use constants we end up leaving a lot of unneeded ones languishing in the codebase when code changes",

      "message": "I think its case by case basis. If the same test-id is used in many files, making a constant will save time in the long run. If its 1-off element that feels like it'll be a 1-off element, then just use the string directly.\n\nI make the mistake of using strings for any pollen element but those are elements where constants would be great because if liam changes it in pollen, then we wouldn't have to change any of our tests.",
