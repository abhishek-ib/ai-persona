They had the feedback that there were changes over the last two days which broke their current integration.

      "message": "@Ben Wood we definitely could have been more proactive about communicating to customers on this one, but I think the reason we didn’t was that we didn’t see it as “breaking” their integrations. If they had a downstream integration on an app, they should see a message that integrations on apps are no longer supported and guiding them through creating a deployment with that same integration. Did this migration path not work for them, or did they not want to do it? cc @hannah",

      "message": "Ahhh I think the miss here is that community users don’t have access to deployments (where integrations are now configured) and so they probably were not prompted to create a deployment and so it just broke for them. For commercial users, the migration path is seamless as we prompt them through the new workflow. This is definitely on me. We should have caught this and proactively communicated to any impacted community users.",
