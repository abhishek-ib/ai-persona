This creates new columns that make job table accesses faster and make filtering on attributes like flow pipelines, review states, reviewer doable/faster.\n\nIf you have an existing sandbox that you want to update to a commit more recent than yesterday, you need to run a dbupdate. Instruction for this coming soon.\n\nReader and Dataset Add Files (from ML Studio) jobs are currently broken. We are working on fixing it. This is also affecting dogfood stability.
