      "message": "Hi all, i’ve been working in the platform loads today for different customer projects, and it’s been really good to see the sort of use cases we can now handle when you know how to use the platform. I’ve had some quite challenging use cases involving non-latin characters and its been working great. (Take a look at the screenshot!)\n\nThat being said there is a collection of different feedback here that I think would help improve the UX and make it so customers can be more self sufficient and not need my help to get their projects working fully.\n\n*High Priority*\n• Improve consistency of the no results found responses (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1232)\n• Improve confidence scoring by incorporating OCR confidence values. (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1230)\n*Medium Priority*\n• Summary table view of results with final validation result (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1228)\n• Add ability to reorder clean functions. (https://instabase.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/EPD/issues/EPD-1229)\n• Need to be able to see a document preview when in the table view for extraction results.
