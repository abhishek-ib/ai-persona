      "message": "Hi Team,\nI am testing a product recommendation use case using our converse app and wanted some advice if the below observations can be improved upon.\n\n*Context:* In my previous company, we collaborated with huge retail brand to build a product recommendation bot using the CCaaS solution. While their FAQ bots were scaled globally, they hesitated to trust AI for recommending skin or hair care products due to health implications. Product queries were redirected to agents, who relied on Excel sheets for recommendations, resulting in high turnaround times.\n\n*My approach with IB AI Hub:*\n1. Created a dummy Excel sheet with hair and skincare products.\n2. Built a Converse project in Instabase and fed the data to AI Hub.\n3. Queried the data to simulate real-world use cases.\n*Observations:*\n• The bot provided accurate recommendations but inconsistent responses (e.g., some with links, some without).\n• Ideal flow: Recommend a product first, then ask if the user wants more details or to purchase—this could be refined with better prompts?\n• Issues with phrasing: The bot frequently referenced \"document,\" which is unsuitable for end-user interactions, as they are unaware of backend data sources. Is there a way this can be improved upon? \nHappy to chat more on this :)",
