      "message": "Regarding IBOCR bloat conversations from a while ago, if this is still a problem and just needs a quick fix, I have a notebook that does some size reduction. Even with confidence levels still tracked, it achieves a 45% reduction in file/object size. It's kind of janky and experimental, but if a quick fix is needed, you can always use this technique and have a `compress()` and `inflate()` function available that does the conversion for you: https://www.instabase.com/user/vontell-nb/notebooks/vontell/workspace/fs/Instabase%20Drive/experiments/reduced-ibocr-size/IBOCR%20Reduction.ipynb",

      "message": "Basic idea is to convert long lists of dictionaries into dictionaries of lists, and then replace key names with 1-2 character alternatives - pretty simple changes like that can get quite a reduction in size already, and I bet there are techniques to bring this down even further",
