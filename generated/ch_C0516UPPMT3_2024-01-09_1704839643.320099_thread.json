      "message": "Please see guidance from Kerry Change that was emailed company-wide earlier:\n\n*1. Ib_llm_tools Policy Clarification* \nib_llm_tools (the ability to call any GPT models from Refiner) can be used by Instabase employees *only* when using Instabase’s Open AI account. Sharing it with customers requires exec approval.\n\n_Background_\nInstabase has a fixed rate limit with Open AI that cannot support an excessive number of LLM calls. Giving ib_llm_tools to customers without careful supervision and education may result in inefficient solutions that quickly depletes our predefined rate-limit (for example, making an LLM call for every field to be extracted). If a customer has to build LLM solutions themselves using Refiner, please reach out to your leadership for an exception: this will require customer education and additional management from the post-sale delivery team, in addition to pricing and cost controls.\n\n\n*2. GPT4 Policy Update* \nGPT4 cannot be used in production when using Instabase’s Open AI account. Using it in a PoV requires exec approval.\n\n_Background_\nFor any production LLM solutions using Instabase’s Open AI account, GPT4 is not allowed. The reason is that we do not have a rate limit for GPT4 that we can support production load/scale. Please note that just because GPT4 can give better accuracy than GPT3.5 does not make it OK to use GPT4. Our main problem here is the limited GPT4 availability by Open AI, not our cost (which can be mitigated through contracts).\n\nGiven that GPT4 cannot be used in production, please do not use GPT4 in PoVs. If the use case relies on features only available in GPT4 such as the 32k context window, please reach out to your org leaders for an exception. We may need to disqualify the use case if the product cannot support achieving the use case requirements with GPT3.5 before the production timeline.",
