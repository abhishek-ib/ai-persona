      "message": "Didn't get to react earlier, but this feedback is also MEGA!\n1. @Vishnu this is interesting right? Especially if the OCR is correct. I always assumed that we just grab the OCR value there. \n2. Yeah before this goes to any customers, we will do a UX pass here. These are flows we will be considering cc: @Natasha \n3. Is this selecting multiple parts of the document for 1 answer? In the example what are you looking to do? \n4. Yeah this is super interesting. The 2 shot story is one we've heard in the context of tables (Extract all the table, now take action with these). Regardless curious of @Vishnu’s thoughts here too!\n5. Agree here, but we will try to explore a bit more with vision models. This mode of interactions makes a lot of sense here. \n6. @danny.lan this last part does seem like a bug. Do we have a ticket for this?",
