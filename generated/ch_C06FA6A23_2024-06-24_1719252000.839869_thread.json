      "message": "Hi everyone, following up on @donagh’s announcement above regarding post-install v2 I wanted to share the UI changes that were made in Deployment Manager made to support this migration. The major update is that *we’ve replaced the post-install actions dialog with a table on the infra dashboard jobs page*. While the information you can find here is predominantly the same, there are a few differences from the old dialog:\n• If an action is scheduled and waiting on one or more dependencies to complete before running, this information will be available when hovering over the loader icon\n• You can now individually run or abort any action, as well as run/abort all actions at once\n• Custom UIs/tables for actions are no longer supported. This means that all information regarding the status of an action should be found in the action’s logs\nThe removal of the v1 modal won’t be backported to older releases so you’ll be able to use both until 24.07-enterprise / 24.26-aihub, but as you start to use the table more please send any comments/feedback over to <#C047ST1SUPP|>!",
