JPMC is setting this as a requirement for them so they can charge back LLM usage to the correct teams within their organization. they will be customer-hosted and using their own LLM endpoints, so they will be paying the LLM charges as well as AI Hub charges. we have this ticket (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2318) for metronome, but the scope does not include LLM token usage.\ncc @tamir",

Or perhaps a monthly report we could provide?\n• Additionally, if this is something we already have visibility into (but not surfacing), could we do our own calculations as to what an average Unit converts to for LLM Tokens? I get that it may not be 1:1, but perhaps there's an average or rough estimate we could help them figure out",
