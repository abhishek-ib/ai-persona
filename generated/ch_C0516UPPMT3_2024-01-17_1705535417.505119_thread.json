      "message": "Following up on this thread for Docs... Can someone please clarify for me: what is the recommended method to extract *multipage tables* in Build 24.02+? In previous versions, we recommended object detection + reasoning prompt, but on `aihub-uat` today, I'm getting about the same results with and without object detection + an extraction prompt. Slightly better _without_ object detection, actually. A reasoning prompt always results in `No value found.` So, it seems like the best way to extract multipage tables is with no object detection + extraction prompt. :question-block:",

Can you share your example? @Rakesh @Lalit",
