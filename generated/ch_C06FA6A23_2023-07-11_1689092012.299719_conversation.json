      "message": "Hello all! I have recently added a CI check, `Py Module Cycle Detection Check` , which will fail if you happen to add circular dependency in python modules. Our legacy build system allows circular dependencies among python modules, which is a big no no from the build perspective. The purpose of the CI check is to prevent new circular dependency from being added to the _master_ branch’s build tree. We already have pretty huge python cycles and don’t want them to grow more than what we have today.\n\nIf the check detects new cycles, it will report this with a message like below and the link to a doc that guides how to resolve the cycles. The check is *not required to pass at the moment*, but we will make it mandatory for merge soon. Please feel free to ask questions on <#C035SLYCJ9X|> regarding this. Thank you!",
