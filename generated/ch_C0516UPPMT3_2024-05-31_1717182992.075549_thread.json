      "message": "Prompt Based Validations feedback:\n\nDuring yesterday's AI Hub advancements session, I asked for guidance on how to write prompts for our new prompt based validation feature (which feels 99% magical BTW).  I think having a sample prompt prepopulated would help guide users on an ideal structure, as I consider myself pretty adept at prompt engineering, but still ran into times where the prompt would error out and the system couldn't converge on creating a summary, code, & validations from it.\n\nFurther, I believe the feature is slightly buggy at the moment: When I can get it to converge, I notice that  the validations always fail, even if I add examples cases from the documents (notice how in the 2nd screenshot it says PASS for the `Actual outcome`, but the `Validation Result` column says FAIL).\n• I believe this is caused by the field name mismatch between the def line and when that variable is used in the function: `Invoice Balance Due` vs `invoice_balance_due` notice the capitalization and spaces.\n• It's likely causing a compilation error, but it's hard for me to know what the problem is due to the next point:\n*We should display the validation message to the users in Build* to help troubleshoot what is going wrong.\n\nLastly, it'd be great if the code could be edited in this mode, as minor tweaks like this or changes to the validation failure message(s) would often be essential for taking a build app solution to prod.\n\nhttps://aihub.instabase.com/hub/build/018fbee1-9026-7967-9bae-0df5e939fd06",

Its worth investigate and I feel like i've seen that issue before on Slack.\n\nTo your other points:\n1. Is it feeling magical good or bad? \n2. Sample prompt work - @andy we should sync on this",
