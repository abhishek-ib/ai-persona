      "message": "How expensive is pinning a Crafting Sandbox? I had pinned my sandbox for the last couple of weeks (initially for a test and then I forgot to unpin it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and noticed that my day started much better for those two weeks. Normally, the sandbox shuts down every day and I have to restart it at the start of the next day. I usually end up wasting ~15 mins in this process and sometimes more, if I need to resolve issues with services not starting up correctly. Is it ok to leave it pinned for ever?",
