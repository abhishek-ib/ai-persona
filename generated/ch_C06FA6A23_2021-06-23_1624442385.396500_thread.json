      "message": "Hi all, few queries and comments:\n\n• What files on IB currently should not be moved, as they link back to a DB. `batch.ibflowresults` the `S1, S2, S3, S4` fodler… anything else?\n• Is there a way that we can highlight in the UI - either by changing colour… or by just preventing anyone from moving them? NatWest have just “tidied” their filesystem and now nothing will open… because all the file paths are wrong. \n• This shouldn’t be allowed to happen really - most users are going to assume the IB filesystem works like any other filesystem. It’s a very easy mistake to make - and potentially NatWest have now lost a bunch of goldens.\nCC @Lee @vineeth @Kerry @Jessica",

      "message": "Nothing in the output folder should be moved, and the output folder itself shouldn’t be moved too. The DB keeps tracks of flow run status, and if a flow is paused (like a flow stops at a checkpoint), when resuming the flow the DB needs to know where the latest output data are and resume from there. To solve this problem fundamentally we will want flow runs to be in a location that is read-only for the user and only editable through flow apps. It’s not really related to if data are in the DB or in the FS or both.",
