We want to hide distracting ui from users, (i.e human reviewers). For pages orthogonal to workspaces, we hide UI based on users' highest role across shared workspaces. Things will be clearer once we disable personal workspaces for selected users.\nUsers should probably either:\n• not have personal workspaces, and their highest roles are reviewers across shared workspaces → so they can't create project/chat at all\n• have personal workspace and their highest roles are developer/above → so they can create project/chat\nI do agree that the current behavior is odd :sweat_smile:\ncc @jack.robbins",
