What I've been doing so far is to check \"break on subtree modification\" option.\nToday, I found a better alternative: Chrome has an \"Emulate a focused page\" option. When it's enabled, clicking on dev tools won't cause the focused element to lose focus.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/63905339 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/63905339)\nIn my demo, I tried to inspect the tooltip content and wanted to add a margin to the `p` tag. 1st screen recording shows what happened when it's off and the 2nd one shows what happened when it's on.",
