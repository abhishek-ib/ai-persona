      "message": "Hi, uploaded this document to converse and asked questions (in advanced mode) like \"are there any contradictions in the rules in this document\"? and \"which of the explains have the bouwkundig rapport as a required document?\"\n\nConverse seems to be having a really hard time with these questions. It either says I can't answer this question, or returns 1 of the explains, while there are multiple that have the required document.\n\nIs there a better way to ask the question or is this just the downside of chunking?",

Are we looking at being able to solve the multiple chunk problem?\n\nIt looks like we need more enablement here as this has come up a few times. It would be good know if the message is this is something thats being worked on, or if its an issue that will be with us for a while, as this will adjust our conversations with customers.",

However, based on the shared text, the document appears to contain different rules and guidelines for various situations and scenarios. Some rules may seem contradictory, but they could be applicable to different situations or under specific circumstances.
