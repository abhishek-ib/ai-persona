      "message": "Hi all -- had a call w/ Aayush to work through some issues with his sandbox. Issues we ran into:\n\n1. `python` was missing (see above (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1741785855183549))\n2. `manifest-overrides.json` was set manually (by Aayush) to use `runlocal` for `webapp`, which led to problems with `libmagic`. We reverted the override, which fixed this.\n3. The database was not migrated. Ran `make -C shared-utils/go-utils/src/instabase/utils/db db-dev-init` to fix; alternatively `cs build`\n4. Bazel's build cache was corrupted -- fixed by running `rm -rf ~/.cache/bazel`\n5. We had to follow these instructions to get Google Drive connectors working (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IndR3LfrkciQR-M_of76Rdxd9uAIMRSaXRirhTLyBcw/edit?tab=t.0) for the sandbox. This can go away when we have OAuth Proxy working (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUSwbTMmmDKy2eJSv7zHMZogfA-6cRirTjvTF5btbtU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dh2zo44dkqsp) (@abhijnan is working on it)\n6. Connectors were not built. See: Guide: Testing Connectors in Crafting (https://docs.google.com/document/d/123GS1wjx7-UbHDNhzQAwqkjuQyGSoW1RBNOexUgOtw8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1idcem6s10ph). Action item: make connector builds automatic somehow.\n7. Kubernetes namespace was broken. Ran `make -C tools/connectors/dev-setup` to fix; alternatively `cs build`\n8. Had to create an enterprise org and enable the search feature flags\n[1], [3], [6], [7], [8] are areas where we can remove some friction. I'll think about ways to automate these steps.\n\nFortunately, his sandbox is up & running now, and he can test search!",
