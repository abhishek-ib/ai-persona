See this document for more information. I’ve recorded two videos which give you the background on why we have them, and how to set one up yourself.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1abIC5dqt_YET4szxEh6pjd83DA2LIRNEypZGDleWtQ0/edit#heading=h.mnx3ibo1w1wj\n\ncc: @Jessica @Heymian @shaunak @Mohit @achao @Eric Han @Chetan @lydia @Aaron Vontell @Erick @Shivam @sudeep @Hari + others who likely will be writing Flask handlers and wanting to setup tests for them.\n\nThanks Shaunak for first figuring out how to set these up!",
