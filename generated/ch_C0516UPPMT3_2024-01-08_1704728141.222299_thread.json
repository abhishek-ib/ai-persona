      "message": "Hey team, Happy New Year!\n\nA couple of questions related to the GPT-4 usage policy change, with the context that we’re planning for an enterprise customer who is starting to take ownership of a production solution that is using LLMs through Refiner:\n• Are there plans for `ib_llm_tools` or similar to programmatically block/prevent/obfuscate users from opting into GPT-4? I know it is opt in at the moment already, but wondered if we are planning for any additional guardrails\n• Is there anything we can do to monitor GPT-4 usage? For example, any Grafana dashboards/alerting that are set up to pick up when GPT-4 has been specified so that we can take action?",
