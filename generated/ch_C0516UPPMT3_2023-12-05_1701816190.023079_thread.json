Here's what I recommend:\n\n*Default drive has changed*\nAn admin changed the default drive for your organization. You must either migrate this project to the new default drive or delete it.\n[Delete project] [Move project]\n\nPlease can we spare users the explanation of what a default drive is? Even I could not read all this copy!\n@Arjun Can you update this modal for Build?",

Build: We need to update the modal with the proposed copy changes above. @Arjun I think we need your help here. \n2. Converse: We need to add a modal when the user first opens the project. They can close out of it and keep using the project. If they try to add files, I suggest the banner pops up. The user can close it and keep working (same behavior as we have). @Vasu I think we might need your help implementing these changes (new modal + copy changes to banner)",
