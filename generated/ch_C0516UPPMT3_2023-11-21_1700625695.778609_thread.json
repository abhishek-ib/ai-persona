In case anyone wants to try it, here's (probably) the first shared app on prod to Process Flight Tickets with Instabase AI Hub (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/dabb94ae-220c-45d6-8f60-3267a43cdb55) :airplane: :share:  More to come once the release settles down about promoting the feature. For now, would love your feedback. You can share any apps you've created using the share button on the app page.",

But this hurts potential virality.\n\nBut could we quickly create a variation of this page to say that apps are not supported on mobile and they should come back on desktop for the next release? @Travis",
