      "message": "Hi all, I've been noticing that when running CI against PRs, its often to get mypy issues with the AccountService python stubs, but interestingly, this doesn't happen all the time. For instance, on this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/48257), I'm getting a bunch of errors in CI like\n```[2023-10-16T18:06:12.099Z] /instabase_dir/distributed-tasks/celery/app-tasks/build/py-stubs/stubs3/instabase/account/AccountService.pyi:49: error: Name 'BatchSetSiteAppPermsReq' is not defined```\nwhich are pretty unrelated to my changes.\n\nSometimes, these kinds of errors (one example is the one reported here (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C06FA6A23/p1696963576471119)) go away after running CI a few times (although I haven't experienced that with this PR). Has anyone encountered this or have ideas of how to fix this? This is an issue that has slowed down development alot for me and a few others.",
