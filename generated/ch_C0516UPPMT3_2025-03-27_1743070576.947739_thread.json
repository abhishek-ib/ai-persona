      "message": "Hey team, we just had a demo with the automation team at NAB (who currently use Kofax) and they had some asks for features that I don't think we currently have. Any insight on these would be great - also happy to make tickets for things if we haven't heard these before.\n\nI'd like to provide some answers back to the customer on these points.\n\n1. Sub-page document splitting \n    a. Request: can you classify pages with multiple doc types on them e.g. drivers license scan and passport on same page? I've heard this from a few customers (UOB, ANZ, NAB)\n    b. Can we do this as an advanced app?\n2. Document upload type\n    a. Request: can you accept .zip files?\n    b. Not currently possible, but presumably a bit of code to unpack the zip pre-upload would work as a workaround? Is this possible with a custom upstream integration for when we pull files from a storage facility?\n    c. Maybe a candidate for an option in deployments for unpacking zip files pulled from upstream\n3. Packet Types Meta-data\n    a. Request: does pdf meta-data get passed on to the new split-out documents when using split-classifictaion? \n    b. See attached screenshot of meta-data he was referring to\n    c. Apparently this is useful for fraud detection downstream so they want to make sure they have access to the information\n    d. I explained we could probably access this using the API hierarchy to access the original packet meta-data, but building and maintaining a separate section of code is not attractive to them\n4. Redaction (general)\n    a. Request: can we use AI Hub to redact documents? \n    b. I hear this request a lot (ANZ had this) - sometimes customers don't want us to \"read\" the info to then redact it. In this case NAB seemed open to this though\n5. Redaction (images)\n    a. Request: can we redact images on passports/drivers licenses? \n    b. They want to store files after processing in a redacted format. They want to redact text details, but also want to redact the images on these docs.",

      "message": "1. @Venkatesh might have more context if we've done this before\n2. I think this has also been done with an advanced app. We have the ticket for this but have not prioritized. cc: @jack.robbins potentially another case where the upstream UDF could get us around the native limitations \n3. I'm not quite sure how much metadata is captured and how it is propagated. cc: @Nikolaos Kofinas (splitting) / @Balaram (metadata) in case you folks know. \n4. I think we've done this in advanced apps - we have a ticket out for this and may consider this as a part of hidden fields (tbd if its part of v1). \n5. Hmm this one seems trickier but another question for the soleng team",
