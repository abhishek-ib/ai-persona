      "message": "Hey team, regarding Ground Truths, I'm running into multiple bugs. Just curious, what are the standard tests we do  for features within Golden Review/Creation? Some of these functionalities I assumed would be part of standard/expected behavior. If there's no standard, any ideas of what we could to standardize things?\nHere's 2 bugs I reported just now: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1749164681525789\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1749164185725049\n\nNot having fields show up when the splits are changed are a large blocker, blocking me from completing a GT set as Extraction is necessary to test against. It's time sensitive, I can work around it, but we should probably fix this gap asap",
