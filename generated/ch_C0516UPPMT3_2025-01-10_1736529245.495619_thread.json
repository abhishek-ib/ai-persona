I would assume that clicking the app name would open the app. Instead I am presented with an error modal and redirected to Home.\n\nI would expect for this error message to appear as an overly over the initial screen. Being redirected and then dumped out on Home isn't ideal.\n\n(screenshots attached, in order)",

But yeah, this should be fixed by the app sharing initiative!",
