A lot of our customers using Instabase.com (http://Instabase.com) ask how they can send us documents and have a File Submission App that allows me to give them a link and a repository it will dump the files into would be amazing. This is a growing problem.\n\nToday I have to create them an account using our super weird token system and them show them how to create a hard repo and then how they should upload.",
