That said, if _just_ the Automation metrics API can be ported over as-is, we can perhaps work on that.",

      "message": "We’d love that too, @david.lee, but we can’t just move Platform API docs to the AI Hub docs. Or rather, we _can,_ but it is a really poor user experience full of pitfalls, distractions, and misinformation.\n\nAFAICT, *none* of the Platform APIs can just come over to AI Hub in a usable way. They are not Open API compliant, so we cannot generate reference docs. Ideally, Eng would refactor the API as an OpenAPI-compliant AI Hub API. However, since they’ve just told us they don’t have the bandwidth to do this for Filesystem, which has been in use in AI Hub for a year, I doubt they can do it for metrics.\n\nThe next best thing would be for Eng (or other subject matter expert, such as a sales engineer? :eyes: ) to draft bespoke AI Hub docs for this specific API, which we could then polish up for publication in AI Hub.\n\nIf you are content to point your customers to the existing API just as it is, then it is publicly available in the Platform docs. I don’t love that idea, but I can’t stop you.\n\nWe keep hearing that APIs are important to customers---if true, we should consider whether we are giving them appropriate priority in our roadmap planning.\n\ncc @jack.robbins",

I also hear requests for access to:\n\n• Automation metrics (includes the APIs behind Deployment metrics & Review Metrics - Automation was the term used for both & may be carried from IB Platform (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/apis/v2-apis/automation-metrics/index.html))\n• Deployment APIs (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2943)\n• Run Logs\n• Audit logs\nWe just need to spend the time to assess the amount of effort needed from engineering and what the trade-off would be. There may be some actual development work required to make these safe for MT customers, which is also why we can't simply migrate the IB platform docs.",
