      "message": "*Selection Based Prompt Generation Feedback*\nHey, this is going to be a *MEGA* feature:the_horns: Here's some feedback/issues I've had while playing around with it:\n1. Text selection not matching up with selected text (see screenshot)\n    a. The OCR text looks fine, but for some reason the selected text seems to be a rearranged version of what I've selected.\n    b. Weirdly when I hit generate, it pulls the correct result regardless\n2. I forgot to change the extraction type to table extraction\n    a. If the user selects content from within a table we might want a pop-up to check thats what the user wants? I.e. ask them if they want table type instead\n3. When selecting multiple parts of the document, we should have a better way of denoting the selected text\n    a. Even a different line for each different section?\n4. In some cases the tool did a better job than I could do in writing prompts to extract the data. In this example it was able to generalise to pull all tables in the Securities section (sometime 1 table, often more)\n    a. The only limitation was that sometimes (as in this case) you need a mix of table data and text data. What I want here is an extra column that says which sub-section the security corresponds to e.g. Security to be released\n    b. Would be cool if I could use the tool to combine both text data and table data - maybe in a 2-shot fashion? So I have extracted the tables I was looking for, now can I do a second set of selections to augment the original extraction and get exactly what I want. (this feels kind of like a derived field)\n5. One of the hardest tasks to prompt is to identify if a document has been signed by someone (esp when there are multiple signatures)\n    a. Would be cool if we could use this feature for that\n    b. Similarly I imagine here we want a few-shot approach, so as you find incorrect examples you can correct the solution and it updates its prompt\n6. When I select the tool it drags me to the start of the document\n    a. Seems like a bug\ncc @Kaustubh (KD)",
