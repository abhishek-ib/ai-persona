Most you could do is to trace the /run call in api-server and nginx log(no productive to search for the payload, only will determine the /run call landed). Also if you are getting the uuid back, you can try tracing it on jaeger through /run operation and api-server services to see if that helps. At same point of time, check on the file-tservice log as well to see if there is file folder creation problem",
