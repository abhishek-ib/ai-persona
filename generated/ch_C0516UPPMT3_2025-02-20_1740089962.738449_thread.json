These are great flags -\n\nRegarding the company holidays -- this is the shared HR google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ALQghXdTXq8GUk9PVA) that is currently configured for search. I'm not finding company holiday file in that drive which is why you probably aren't getting results. I do believe that  information is in Confluence (although I can't login at moment) which we are adding soon, so hopefully you'll get an answer to this question once that's updated! And in general this is one of the reasons why we are pushing hard to extend our connectors framework -- search is really only as useful as data it has access to!\n\nRegarding the ability to use meta-data to personalize results - I don't believe we do that now (cc: @Hari - curious if we have ever talked about that on model dev side). But I agree we may want to explore opportunities in that area at some point!",
