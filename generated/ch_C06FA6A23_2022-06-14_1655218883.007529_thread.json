      "message": "We are seeing Control Plane Patches created in Dogfood where the Patch is a copy/paste of the entire config, including the image URL / tag field. Note that this is not the intended usage of patches and caused the image URL to get pinned to the specific tag in the patch.\n\nJust a reminder that the way Patches work is they overwrite values in the base configuration. They are used to modify, remove, or append specific fields and are always applied on top of the base configuration. You can always learn more about how patches and configuration management works in our confluence docs (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CP/pages/1629650971/Configuration+Management). *Please be careful when making platform / infrastructure changes, since you will affect the entire environment;* you can always request a code review (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/tree/master/deployment-configs) for your patches if you are unsure on how to use them.\n\nIn the case that a bad patch was applied or you want to debug the environment, we have APIs to inspect configurations, patches, etc and delete patches to revert them: https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/reference/apis/control-plane/#delete-patch\n\nWe are introducing additional safe-guards this week to prevent these patches from being introduced alongside better access control, audit logs, and other enhancements.",
