For example, is it best to use either of these approaches?\n• Marx V3 - zh:en translation - translation looks good, but we lose the spacial integrity in the OCR output. \n• Translation Model \n• (another approach I don’t know of)",

      "message": "Currently for chinese documents we can use Msft Read 3.2 containers in combination with the Msft Translate Containers.\n\nThe current implementation for this is very naive.  We take the entire page text in the source language, and send it to the translation service.  In doing this, we might lose some spatial layout properties of the page.\n\nWe can try to come up with a different approach for partitioning parts of the page that we send to translation into batches, and then reforming the spatial layout of the page.  For things like Chinese to English, it is especially hard because characters can correspond to multiple words and vice versa.\n\nI do think we can make improvements on this, we just need to come up with a better algorithm/approach for how we send text to translation.",
