I would recommend making sure your fields are in an order where `field_2` (which references `field_1`) comes after `field_1`.",

Let me know if you run into it again :blush:\n\nThe easiest way to reproduce it would be to open the Refiner and _only_ “run field” on `field_2` without running `field_1` beforehand (but that is intended behavior — I can improve the error message if people are running into that). If you ever see this issue when clicking “Run All,” and the fields are definitely in a good order (`field_2` is after `field_1`), then we definitely have something to fix.",
