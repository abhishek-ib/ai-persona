      "message": "PSA: If you are using a local environment, but testing against Dogfood's DB (I think this applies to most IB engineers), there is a gotcha to watch out for: Your local instance has a *different Redis cache* than Dogfood. If you change something in Dogfood's DB that is Redis-cached (like ACLs), then *your laptop will not reflect those changes because it has a different cache that is not invalidated by Dogfood.*\n\nThis can lead to subtle and confusing behavior when developing.  Workaround is to flush your local Redis using the `FLUSHALL` command. You can also disable caching entirely, but this is quite slow.\n\nRelated: Proposal to use local database by default in developer environments (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GH6QDANK1bADaVeftpwEMVCx048wADsstT_awhZytRo/edit#heading=h.icdiroxjkoww)!",
