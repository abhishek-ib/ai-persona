We had some success and even demoed it to customers who liked it. I guess it should perform better now. \n\nHowever, a raw capability to summarize is not sufficient - as part of a complete flow we need to have a draft mapping output that aligns with industry standards (and then present the ability to query and change the mapping as an extra). We are competing directly with companies who make these summaries by hand.",
