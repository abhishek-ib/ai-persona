      "message": "Hi team,\n~when working with \"custom functions\" - is it possible to get a feature to be able to pass output of certain fields into the function as an argument?~\n~for example -~\n1.  ~i have a field called \"bank statements\" that extracts entire list of transactions~ \n2. ~I want to build a field using a udf that sums up all the transactions within the list~\n~currently to do this, i have 2 options :~\n\n1. ~duplicate the field, use udf as a cleaning function  -> Not desirable since if i have to change the prompt on the original field, ill have to do the same here~\n2. ~(The approach I am using right now) create a derived field, reference the target field in the prompt as \" return <derived field> as-is\" and add a cleaning udf -> also not desirable since this depends on the mercy of the LLM to return the same format field without any explanations~ \nEdit:  completely missed the \"add argument\" button under the UDF field, please ignore this! thanks @Ananya for the help!",
