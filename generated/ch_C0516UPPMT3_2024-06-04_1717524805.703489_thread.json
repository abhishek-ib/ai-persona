Note in this screenshot, we are pulling from the earned column for the first 3 but correctly pulling from the paid column in the last row. However, only the last row has the difference between earned and paid. The values in the end are all correct. Is there logic that pushed the last row to be taken from the paid column?\n\ncc: @Sunny Khatri",
