      "message": "Hi team, in build app while using derived fields, the UX would be a lot better if the field name autofill popup appeared only after @ symbol instead of when trying to write prompts, the reason is that  editing the prompt while the popup appears continuously often resets the cursor position to the start of the text input box, especially if you are trying to adjust it in the first place, which is frustrating to work with.",
