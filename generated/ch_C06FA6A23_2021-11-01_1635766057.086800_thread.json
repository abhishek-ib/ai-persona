E.g. if the timeout is 1hr, anytime after an hr, if the user tries to do anything on the website, they will be logged out. But we do not, proactively, at the 1hr mark force logout the user everywhere.\n5. I don’t know either.",

I’m not sure what those headers do, but Natwest flagged that we didn’t use them.\n6. some specific things they flagged: numbers and special characters allowed in first/last name, non-numbers allowed in phone number, html tags allowed in input. This one was marked with very low priority on the report though.",
