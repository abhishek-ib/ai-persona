Let us know how we can most easily accomplish that\n\n2. Release notes! We'd benefit from a more centralized / coordinated process\n\n3. Clients themselves struggle to understand what version and instance they are running. As a client coordinator it'd empower the customer if they could tell me what version their environment was running",
