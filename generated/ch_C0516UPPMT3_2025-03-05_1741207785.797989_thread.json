      "message": "Hey team! As part of the 25.08 release, we updated the standard and advanced model selection in Build to take advantage of GPT-4o mini and the latest GPT-4o model respectively. This change is now GA on our MT environment and will be released to our ST environments in two weeks when they are updated to 25.08.\n\nBased on our internal benchmarking, the models show modest but consistent accuracy improvements. That said, some build projects can experience slight changes to performance if prompts were overfitted to previous model results. We encourage you to review your build projects and make changes to prompts if needed.\n\nNote this update does not impact any existing commercial and enterprise apps. These apps are frozen and will continue to use previous models. This means your customers should not experience any changes to performance for any application running in production. All new app versions published after this change will take advantage of the latest models.\n\nFor internal employees, you can also use our new AI runtime feature to test the new models before updating your existing applications to the latest AI runtime. This feature is planned to be GA in 24.10 and we'd love your feedback before then!\n\nIf you'd like to send a communication to your customer regarding the model update, you can use the attached draft (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4rbjTz_A19gzWH7tz3vFK_sV2HFL6TAeZCF6kQATLk/edit?tab=t.0).\n\ncc: @lydia @Vishnu",
