The goal is to provide a forum for technical knowledge sharing and discussion within IB Eng. These will be taking place on the alternating weeks without Demo Day.\nFor the very first talk, @Erick will be diving into *how Refiner works under the hood* :refiner:. Please tune in on *Feb 25th at 8:30am PST*!\nIf you have any thoughts/suggestions or want to volunteer to give a talk, please reach out to me!",
