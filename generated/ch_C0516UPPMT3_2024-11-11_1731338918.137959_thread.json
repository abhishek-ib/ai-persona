'When is pay day?' gave me a list of dates corresponding to locations. Both the responses I'm getting now give me below par answers:\n    a. Totally wrong - looking at a payslip in an engineering doc\n    b. Assumes my region to be US/Canada instead of asking me to refine my location/providing all answers for all regions\n2. 'What connected drive options are there for AI Hub?' \n    a. Confuses S3 and Instabase Drive as being the same thing\n    b. Points me to a document I don't have access to\ncc @margaret.tomaszczuk",

      "message": "Hey @Hamish! thanks for flagging this.\n\nRe #1 - agreed this looks off. I just tested a couple of searches myself using our HR data that seem to have changed as well, which makes me think this could be a data issue. cc: @Hari could we check if the mounted HR drive is disconnected? (and would welcome your gut check if anything else looks off!)\n\nRe #2 - @Hamish curious what the response looked like before?\n\nRe. the inclusion of doc you don't have access to - this is actually expected behavior at this moment, as access controls are currently managed at the workspace level. So if data is mounted to the workspace you will be able to get a response based on that data but you won't be able to preview if you don't have access via the provider. This behavior will change when we begin to roll out user/item level ACLs in Q4, starting with Google.",
