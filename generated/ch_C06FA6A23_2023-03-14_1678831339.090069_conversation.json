We have a customer that is sensitive to our IP and I would like to share a udf with our own post processing of images / ocr data  and today the only way to secure, it is get it in the core platform where it can be abstracted away. I would love to be able to have a way to have dev exchange potentially be fully encrypted unless we already support this today",
