      "message": "Ok, this is very valuable feedback; thanks for collecting that from the customer.\n\nThe `aihub` to `apps` API change was announced here https://docs.instabase.com/release-notes#api--sdk-3 back in 24.36 (Sep 16). Don't think it ever reaches the customer.\n\nThink we need to update our process to announce API deprecations, people apparently don't read it  -- a common practice is supporting the older format for a month or two while proactively sending emails to the customers still using the endpoint to ask them to change before a certain date. At a certain date, we will delete that API. We also need to prioritize some resources to improve the metrics side of this to track / delete legacy APIs efficiently. cc @hannah @Ram Prasanna I'll work with you on the process.\n\nMeanwhile @Anil @Abhishek Adupa can you still run a retro on how / if the batch_id param stops supporting strings in this release -- I know we think (and user reported) it was never supported, but according to this somehow it did and the behavior changed. Let's at least do our sanity check; meanwhile there're clear next steps.",
