Fixed with new debounce “run immediately” callback  (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/65708)which the live test now invokes via the enter key instead of clicking “Run all”.\n• :white_check_mark: `run-app.spec.ts` was failing due to backend issue related to checking org tier, fixed by https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/65884\n• :white_check_mark: `loginless-sample-results` showing “you do not have access to this app” (also affects `run-public-app.spec.ts`) moved to non-blocking for now ~but should be fixed soon (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1733432399620919?thread_ts=1733424839.667839&cid=CSY11CK7T)~ & is now fixed\n• :question: `downstream-integrations.spec.ts` failing due to too many db connections (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1733518292748369?thread_ts=1733437244.441529&cid=CSY11CK7T), may need to move to non-blocking if not resolved soon.\n• :x:`converse-app.spec.ts` failing on `uploads, digitizes, deletes, and displays the files correctly`, not fixed yet but moved to non-blocking for now",
