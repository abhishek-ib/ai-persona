      "message": "Hey all! I currently have a PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/30498) out that's passing a unit test locally, but failing during `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge` . The PR includes a newly added file that is used for mocking via a `copy_local_dir_to_ib_filesystem` function call. When ran locally, `ibfile.exists(<newly-added-file>)` evaluates to true and the unit test succeeds, but during the jenkins test, `ibfile.exists(<newly-added-file>)` evaluates to false as indicated by my '<file> does not exist' error and the test fails. Does anyone have ideas on why this might be happening?",

      "message": "I’m not too familiar with Python but I took a look at your PR. I noticed that you were mocking with `cast(mock.Mock, …)`, which isn’t something I’ve seen too often in the codebase. The more common way of mocking is with the `@mock.patch()` decorator, so perhaps if you mock using that, it would solve the issue?",
