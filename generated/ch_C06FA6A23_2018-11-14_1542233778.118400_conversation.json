      "message": "Something semi-related Iâ€™ve been to bring up is the concept of unit-tests inside UDFs. Define a function handler that allows the user to specify sample inputs/outputs and run through a series to tests to sanity-check before starting execution of the UDF. Almost everyone I know who writes a UDF has a mental list of inputs to test when they change the UDF. You can always run the entire flow on a new set of documents, but this is perhaps useful to ensure cases that are not touched by these specific input files still work.",
