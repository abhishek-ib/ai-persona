      "message": "Hi, We are moving the aihub apps development work from UAT to Dev environment. We were thinking of downloading the aihub folder from UAT account and replace it on the dev env so that all of the builder/refiner/flow starts working as it is. But looks like there’s a limit on the number of files which can be zipped into a folder and we can’t download and move the entire folder. Do we have any other idea in mind for copying over the entire content from UAT to Dev or it has to be done separately for each folder?\ncc: @Balaram @avi",
