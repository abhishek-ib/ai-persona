      "message": "Hey everyone (especially those who speak multiple languages). We've built a preview of an experimental document translation app and need your help to test it out. You can try it out in the internal sandbox - https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/hub/apps/4b55066c-d99a-4784-a2ee-6db5d3c88ed4. Two known issues to keep in mind:\n1. The app doesn't work if you're not logged in. Please signin with google using your @ instabase.com (http://instabase.com) account\n2. The app only displays the first page of the source document for now. Please reference your original document separately until this is fixed.\nEarly feedback from all of you will be really useful. Please let us know if you run into any issues or if you have any suggestions about its quality. Thanks!",

      "message": "Thanks for the feedback @Xindi Xu!!\n1. This is actually related to the Reader behaviour. The last page of the document seems to be an image where as rest of the document is machine-readable. So reader doesn't capture any text for the last page, and there is no translation. We can turn on the force image OCR for handling these cases, but then we lose styling information (bold, italics, etc.) which is readily available in machine readable documents. We will also be doing OCR for all pages of machine-readable PDFs! Let me check with the team if there is any other way to handle this.\n2. We do segmentation of text and apply translations to those segments. Generally I have seen good detection and segmentation for tables. But in this case, it's not detecting that segment as a table which is why the structure is not preserved. You can see that it captures the table right below it correctly. I think it is because there is lesser structure (no borders, no color separation between rows, not much spacing between rows, etc. ) in the table where it failed.\n3. We use Microsoft translator for the job! Haha.",
