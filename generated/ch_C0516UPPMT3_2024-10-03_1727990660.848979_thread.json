      "message": "Build feedback - *Documents sidebar*:\n• As far as I can tell (and I've done a lot of poking around), I can't find a way to resize or hide the Documents pane on the left of the Build dashboard.  It takes up a lot of screen real estate, but I find that I'm not often switching between documents when working on a Build project.  *So I'd prefer the ability to hide or resize it*.\n• When working from my ultrawide monitor, this space is not a huge problem (see SS1).\n    ◦ And it's not terrible working with a Build window side-by-side with a useful reference document (see SS2).\n• However, it takes up way too much space when using Build on my Macbook screen (see SS3).  This is a problem to the point where I can barely read the document at 100% zoom and need to bump it up to 150 or 225%, but then I need to pan the doc side to side to be able to read a whole line, especially annoying when typing out a prompt and needing to reference lines of text in the doc.\n• And just forget about being able to read the doc on a vertical monitor... (see SS4).",
