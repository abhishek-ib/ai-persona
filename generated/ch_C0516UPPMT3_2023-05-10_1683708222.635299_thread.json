It is our highest priority post the initial launch. \n\nI’m curious which scenarios are most useful / common from your perspective for multi docs? We are actively discussing which doc types, query types etc to prioritise and any inputs here would be very useful. \n\ncc: @Hari @Rafal",

So i have to trial-and-error to find which doc the answer is within.",

      "message": "Very similar to Weaver I spoke with someone that works closely in credit analysis. They shared their use case of wanting to review the past 4 years of annual reports. They wanted to understand the trend across those 4 annual reports. Things like:\n\nprompt: in a table with fiscal year end as columns show me the following rows: actual revenue, forecasted revenue, percent deviation of actual to forecast\n\nThen when there’s meaningful deviation follow up questions like:\n\nprompt: In FY21 revenue fell short of the target, what are managements reasons explaining why they missed their goal\n\nI’ve tried similar queries on a single doc, and they’ve worked well. It would be a super power to be able to ask questions like these across documents.",
