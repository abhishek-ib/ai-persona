If you see a bunch of errors in the tests run on your PR from tests like run-app, run-public-app, aihub-single classification, take these steps:\n\n1. Go to https://instabase.sandboxes.site/sandboxes\n2. Search for your PR number and delete the sandbox\n3. Go to the details for the run failing run Cypress test and select \"Re-run all jobs\", which will create a new sandbox\nThanks @CJ and @sean.donohoe for investigating this! Hopefully we'll have this root caused and fixed soon.",
