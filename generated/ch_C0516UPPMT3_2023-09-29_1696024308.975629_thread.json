      "message": "Hi Team,\n\nLoved experimenting with the new AI Hub Commercial beta.   Very excited to see the early concepts of validations and human review!\n\nOne thing that appears to be missing is the ability to filter the documents and fields by only those that have failed a validation.\n\nThis is a powerful feature in the field, especially when convincing a customer to pivot away from the idea of only wanting to see STP.   Showing how operators only have to be concerned with the specific documents that failed (versus all), and then calling their attention to only the fields that did not pass validation is key.",
