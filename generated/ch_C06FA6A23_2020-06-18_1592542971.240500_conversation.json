      "message": "hello all, just a heads up that I merged a PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/14406) that changes a dependency in a few services. We now pull the list of apps that show up in launcher from a different place, so youâ€™ll need to restart a few core-services (account, repo and mount) and the four webserver services. Otherwise you might start seeing errors when trying to load apps. This change lets us more easily show/hide apps in our UI or categorize them in different ways.",
