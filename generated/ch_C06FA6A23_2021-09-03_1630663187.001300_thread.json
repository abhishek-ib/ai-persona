That makes the doc view seems getting images back faster, but really this is the slowness in getting the files.\n\n@Matt Weaver, one thing to speed up the grid view - if this is in the July release forward, you add `write_thumbnail` to the process files step. This lets the flow generates smaller thumbnails that help the overall load time for the grid view.\n\nOn my laptop, the images take a while to load. Looking at the console, the content download time is quite long. I’m going to do some research to see if this is my network problem or something with Chrome’s setting.",
