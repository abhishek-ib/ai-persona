I think the fix is to update this line (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/8605ffe87b4414f172a584f1e3de6aeff0907b73/.github/workflows/danger.yml#L16) but I'm not sure if there's an approval process for this to make sure that the new setup-ruby library is ok to use. Does anyone know what the next steps here could be? Maybe @shiqi?\n\nFailing build:",
