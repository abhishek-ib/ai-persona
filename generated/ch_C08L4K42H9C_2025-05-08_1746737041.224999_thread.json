My mental model for deployments is that they're a customized version of an app with specific configs (which is mainly controlled by developers). I feel this particularly constrains the number of deployments which can be created or it requires the workspace owner (which seems to be limited to the admin) to \"promote\" people to manager to be able to create deployments in workspace",
