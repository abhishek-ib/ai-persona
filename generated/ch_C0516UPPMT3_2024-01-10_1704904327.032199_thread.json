It works very well, and I'd like to send its link to some clients, so they can try it with their own AI Hub accounts. Is that possible?\nThe app may be visible to Instabase only.

I'm also not sure that making this a public app is a good idea since we'll want to test the accuracy and will then need to maintain it moving forward. @andy it may be interesting to consider a feature where our sales teams can publish an app as unlisted publicly from their commercial accounts in the future. Or can easily port ai hub apps across accounts/envs. We want to build this anyways for environment portability.\n\n@fernando.piazza.ctr I know this isn't ideal, but for now would it be possible to recreate the app in your community account? Hoping that it may be easy for a small amount of fields",
