I don’t want to speak on behalf of the whole of customer engineering, but at least Zendesk (which I understand won’t be high priority to loop into zscaler) should probably remain accessible for the sake of quick responses. The rest of our services that could contain client information, I would agree are not highly critical to have mobile access",

Zendesk is one of those, but just because something is on that list doesn’t mean it requires Zscaler.",
