This window should avoid impacting most devs, I hope. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThis upgrade will bring us into better compliance with both our and GCP’s security and compliance postures, as well as reducing variables that may be contributing to dogfood’s instability and unpredictability.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns!",
