Responded to some comments and will also let @Anil and @Abhishek Adupa, once they're online, chime in with any concerns with supporting the gemini tasks (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hknWMfuWohjy7OCQodH7edTaVvYoNbHPrLrPpvhmUrY/edit?disco=AAABookm3z8) you've detailed and any thoughts on digitization in app runs and build.\n\nOnce we verify gemini tasks, their input and output interface, and whether we have access to ibmsgs, me and ayesha can iron out any changes to API interfaces and workflows so FE can weigh in",
