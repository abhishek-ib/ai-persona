      "message": "Hi all, I thought I'd relay some feedback on AIHub that we received via a ticket the other day on https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/10059 -- the user experience isn't described well, with issues related to memory consumption and time for specific actions to be performed on the aihub web-page --\n\n```Everything is in the title : AI Hub platform is incredibly slow when running on large projects. \nIts hell.\nFields seems to be reloading at each key down, the app freezes, its response time is so slow,\n\nOr as someone has put it (definitely not me):\n\nIt feels like Instabase invented  a time travel machine to get back to the nineties\n\n\nI doubt this is due to my laptop/browser for the following reasons : \n- I do not encounter the issue elsewhere - neither on my browser nor my development environment\n- even though chrome is sometimes taking up to 7GB (!), I still have spare RAM - and Chrome's RAM limit per tab is 16GB AFAIK\n- the logs are quite obvious - find attached file to see for yourselves: its full of typical warnings like [Violation] Handling of 'touchstart' input event was delayed for 1234 ms due to main thread being busy. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. --> So the main thread seems blocking indeed...\n\n- Tab memory usage seems OK though - around 250-500Mb approximately on average (I made a memory snapshot it was at 300MB).\n\n- I checked performance tab in console it was a mess. Almost 1000ms Interaction to Next Paint. So yeah... waiting 1 second between each click AND in some cases between each KEYDOWN (see attached files)\n\n- A page reload usually helps for a minute or two ( so I was initially thinking memory leak could be the cause)\n- I tried running on firefox but ran in the same latency issue\n\nIf we add to this slowness the fact that the solution sometimes requires LOTS of clicks, like, for example, when we want to move a field from the bottom of the list to the top of the list of 25 fields in our class - but we don't have drag n' drop obviously because why should we have the elegant solution when we can just frantically click 20 times in a row - then it can take minutes to do it. Literally. Minutes to move a field... I have measured 3 seconds on a good trend but it can go up to 5-6 seconds when it really is slow.\n\n\nSo I hope you hear me and do something about this - or maybe I am totally misusing the app and you have advices, I would be glad to hear.\n\nI think I remember opening a similar ticket last year, I hope we find more solutions this time. \n\nregards,\n\nLMI```",

      "message": "The load times they’re describing are understandably frustrating, and unfortunately, this isn’t a new pain point. The fact that they're working with 54 project files (as noted in their Zendesk reply) stands out as a major red flag, since that volume can significantly degrade performance.\n\nIn the short term, I’d recommend using our solution accuracy testing and ground truths (https://docs.instabase.com/automate/testing) feature to run tests asynchronously and reduce the number of project files. This was also engineering’s recommendation (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2662) in similar cases.\n\nLooking ahead, we do have performance-related improvements on the roadmap, like scaling to 250 fields (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3381) per class, but some of that work is currently paused as we prepare for the move to Gemini Flash, which will impact how we extract fields and may offer improvements on its own.",
