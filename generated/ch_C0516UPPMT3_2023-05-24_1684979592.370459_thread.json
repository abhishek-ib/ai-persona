      "message": "This is very meta....\n\nA partner asked me for pricing on processing 600 pages of very complex, unstructured content per month. The actual page count is closer to 9000 pages per month, with data only on about 10 pages of the 60 150 page documents. He wasn't sure how many fields, so I'm estimating 10 fields per 150 page document. I had asked during our session today about pricing. @avi shared the AI Hub - Pricing Policy. I first created a spreadsheet to try and build out the estimated cost. Then, I uploaded the policy document to AI Hub and asked it how much it would cost and it gave me the answer, $42/month. According to the partner, this is costing their customers hours and hours of time every month and we could solve it with AI Hub Pro for $42/month (assuming it is 10 fields/doc). This is incredible.",

      "message": "Does that pricing sound correct? If we processed 9000 pages through our platform, with a very aggressive per page cost of $.10/page, that would still cost $900/month (plus the platform fee). The AI Hub processing would cost roughly $0.005/page, 20 times cheaper.",
