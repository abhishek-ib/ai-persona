      "message": "Hey team! lot of excitement on DocAI in roadmap readout today :raised_hands: ... one feedback point I wanted to surface in this forum was SE really wants to see this item https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-4595 ASAP for demos... which is what will allow them to stop demo-ing Anant's proto basically and start showing this in AI hub, which is very much in our interest from a product signal pov!\n\nMain friction points for @Weiming Wu's proto of auto-generation: need to run a script to use it, performance is a bit slow because we are using old endpoints\n\n@Anil can we look at accelerating an improvement in next release? Happy to look at tradeoffs... this might be worth more than some feature completeness items if it gets SE to adopt. Thanks! cc: @jack.robbins @Serena",
