Here is some feedback I got so far from others:\n- Actually getting the data and sending data over email with the customer\n- Handling multiple datasets and different versions of data over time\n- Sending/compiling the results of some process for some dataset\n- Viewing the overall OCR quality of some intake documents\n- Having a standardized way to load, process, and test/evaluate the results of a dataset",
