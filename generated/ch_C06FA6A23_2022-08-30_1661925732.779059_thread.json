Does anyone know what this particular deployment is referring to?  It is the only remaining piece that is using the ibdata filestore, which we can otherwise remove easily.  [The ibdata filestore was previously used by msft containers which have since been moved over to using envoy and in-memory processing].\n\ncc @Rakesh @Yash Aggarwal",
