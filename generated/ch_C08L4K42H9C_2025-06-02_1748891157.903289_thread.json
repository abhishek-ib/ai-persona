It appears that currently our case management implementation doesn't support such checks, as if a packet has several documents with the same class we select one as the main one and use it, so we can't do validation 7 mentioned people vs 7 IDs.)\n\nIt looks like a case we definitely want to support in the future. Do we have it on our roadmap? If not, do you mind if I create an entry in our backlog so we can include it in the next milestones/plans?",
