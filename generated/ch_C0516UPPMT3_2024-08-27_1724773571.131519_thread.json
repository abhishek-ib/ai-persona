Have we put any thought or experiments around using GenerativeAI to create first version of Build applications?\n> For example, a user provides a description - say \"Create an end-to-end application to classify between document classes A, B and C, and then extract fields [ ... ] from class A, fields. [ ... ] from class B, with validations etc.) - and an initial Build application is created and available for the user to edit / confirm / build upon from there.\n• I'm seeing this more and more with first version of applications, such as AirTable Cobuilder (https://airtable.com/cobuilder) or speaking to Unqork this morning, this is part of their AI efforts (even for migration - I upload a block of Java code for a legacy application and a new Unqork first draft is automatically created).",
