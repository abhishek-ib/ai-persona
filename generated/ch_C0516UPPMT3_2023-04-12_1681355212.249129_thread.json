      "message": "First off - many congrats! It all looks very slick! Have been playing already this week. Worked really well on complex reinsurance contracts that were in typed text PDF. However, it performed poorly on a heavy annual report (I tried AXA’s). I’m wondering why - I asked fairly simple questions like “what are the underlying earnings”. Three specific things related to that:\n\n1) It circled long and then said “I don’t know”. If there is any driver why we don’t know (eg the annual report contained images and tables) and if we can’t process those yet then a more informative error message can be useful\n\n2) It could also be that the spinning and I don’t know has to do with the size of the doc and/or API capacity. But there is no way to know from the error message\n\n3) Is it correct that this version cannot yet output Json tables? I asked it to extract data and put it in a table, and it complied. But following this up with “and now put that table into Json” was met with a “Indont know”",

It likely has to do with the size / number of pages.\n\nIt passed all questions I had on the reinsurance slip (e.g. from which date and for how long is this contract valid, who are the partners - mind you that it was almost impossible to do these slips about a year ago as they are highly variable). The reinsurance slip has been annotated as to which data points it should be able to extract - it passed all of them)",
