Per the below, it sounds like it was not immediately clear to her how to finish “Build” and start running volume through her app:\n\n_“I found the 6 page welcome PDF really helpful and clear. Wow.. I was surprised how easily it worked on the first visa application. My feedback is that it isn’t totally clear what the next step is after schema. If there is an export function, is that on a different page from the documents, and how does that work? Also, one of my volumes is 600MB, so it’s too large to do in one go, but that would be a helpful option.”_",

Secondly, what do they mean by volumes?\n\nFYI - We are working on redesigning home page to make the guidance for Build more clear. @Bastiane",
