      "message": "Hey Orlando, looks like this isn't a bug but maybe confusing UX. The reason you see a change when you go to your community account is because the _context_ is changing so we don't want to show you the project in the old context anymore. When you go to a different workspace within the same context, we'd show you the list of projects in the workspace but not redirect you a new project. This might be made more confusing by the fact that you don't have any projects in that new workspace to show.\n\nI'm not sure it would be less confusing if we redirected you to a project in the new workspace... what if you're just browsing and want to pick a different one from the list? We could also send you to that blank state you saw when you selected the community context, but we're actually trying to get rid of that state.\n\ncc @Kaustubh (KD)",
