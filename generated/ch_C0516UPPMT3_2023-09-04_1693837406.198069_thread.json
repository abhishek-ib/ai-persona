We should believe that the product is stable and will not cause breaking changes unless absolutely required.\n\nDuring Private Preview, we open up the API to a select audience who we can support in a white-glove manner. It is ok to introduce breaking changes during this phase with clear communication. It's still important that we test the product ourselves before we give it to customers in this phase.\n\nOnce Lee is able to run the Converse APIs, it should at least be ready for private preview. The team working on the product (Balaram/Vasu/Varun) should take the call on whether it should go to GA",

From the screenshot, it isn't very clear, it seems the API returned successfully and you faced the error on the converse UI. Are both the conversations same on the UI and the the one you created using the create conversation endpoint?\n3. Were you able to get the status of the conversation creation/processing using Get Conversation endpoint?\nAdding a brief list of the steps to use the Converse APIs below:\n1. Use the Create conversation endpoint to create the conversation (`/api/v2/aihub/converse/conversations`) and upload files to it.\n2. Since, the above steps would upload the documents and trigger the processing for them in the background, we would need to check for the status of their processing using the Get Conversation (`/api/v2/aihub/converse/conversations/{conversation_id_from_the_previous_step}`) endpoint and keep polling it till the `state` shows `COMPLETE` . Once, the processing it done, the `documents` key would be populated with the successfully processed documents (name and document id).\n3. Now, using the document ids produced in the previous step, one can ask any queries using the Ask a question (`/api/v2/aihub/converse/conversations/{conversation_id}/prompts`) endpoint.",
