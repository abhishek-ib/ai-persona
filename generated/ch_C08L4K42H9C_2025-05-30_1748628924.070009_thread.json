So it will be something like that:\n\nDo you think it would be useful?",

If it’s a quick and trivial change to make I think it’d be appreciated and wouldn’t hurt cc @Serena \n\nIn this feature space, the big investment we’re currently designing is the ability to create shared, reusable functions so customers don’t need to rewrite and maintain the same code in dozens of places. This would be a strong candidate for development next quarter.",
