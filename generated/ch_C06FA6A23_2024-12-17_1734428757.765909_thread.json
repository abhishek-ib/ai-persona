Also as mentioned please use trace count limits to make sure we avoid 50x errors.\nAlso in the message above Puneet has reported this issue to Jaeger, and we have not seen a response (i asked them a followup earlier today as well). If we do not hear back we will need to see how to plan for tracing improvements to address this in next quarter. cc @Kerry as well we spoke about this in our discussion a few weeks ago",
