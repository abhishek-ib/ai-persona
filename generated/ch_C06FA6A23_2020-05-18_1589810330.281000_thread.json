I've used workflows that can show Jira issues on a Confluence page (https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/use-jira-applications-and-confluence-together-427623543.html), but mostly I've just used Jira for product feature development. We have integration between Jira and Confluence wiki (https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/confluence-evaluator-resources/confluence-jira-integration-features) pages.\n\nIn my past work lives, we've used Confluence as a place to park big ideas, team-wide pages, and the wiki pages themselves served as a portal. For me, product features that go in product releases have always been tracked in Jira issues.  Your question is a good one. Jira is not perfect, but it is designed for product development workflows and we can improve our efficiency with thoughtful process understanding.",
