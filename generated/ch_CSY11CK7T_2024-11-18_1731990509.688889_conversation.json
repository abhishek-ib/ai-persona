I wanted something lighter weight than monaco since it's just a little json editor\n2. It's actually been a lot easier to style it exactly how I want because it's just css basically\n3. monaco is incompatible with the CSRF settings we want, so we may have to switch from it eventually anyways. Eric Han actually recommended codemirror to me as a replacement when I was complaining to him about the CSRF stuff haha\nLmk what you think!",
