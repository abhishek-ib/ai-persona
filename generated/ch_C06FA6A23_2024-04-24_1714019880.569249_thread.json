      "message": "Hi team, a SAAS customer (RSA) recently shared that they have the following python packages available on their environment - they mentioned that the list is significantly larger than what is mentioned on the documentation (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/24.01/udfs/third-party-libraries-for-udfs/index.html)\nhttps://privatebin.net/?4de916d2e503e56f#6p8TZprfkYhGycEG93dYXgGpUeVucray9gr9Xum1ZMsE\n\nI assume these are dependencies of the required packages to make the web app work -- wanted to confirm if there is any potential downside/risks to using any of these packages within IB since they are not officially listed. They might use these packages in UDFs/refiners/validation scripts moving forwards as per their use case.\n\nI see `botocore` listed here, ~can they potentially use this to access our AWS configurations? Just making sure~\nedit: tested botocore from refiner on platform.ib, no credentials or configs are exposed",
