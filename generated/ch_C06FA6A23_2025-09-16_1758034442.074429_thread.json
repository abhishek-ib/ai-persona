We had believed if the schema.json wasn’t present in the binary, it wouldn’t work, but didn’t exactly track down why the schema.json is only present sometimes. I also tested and found the same with @suleiman.odat’s findings. \n\nIt seems to working as expected for right now, anything to add Pauline?\n\n@suleiman.odat could you help communicate if theres any preservation issues - if there are, we can prioritize it!",
