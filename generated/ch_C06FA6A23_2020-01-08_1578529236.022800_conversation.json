We have:\n\n• A dataset of >500 ID card images AND golden OCR results\n• A series of Jupyter notebooks to act as test harnesses\n• Already-written evaluation functions\nI hope this page is a help -- please pitch in with edits / improvements / requests!\n\nThanks to @Mohit for the OCR experiments that motivated the creation of this resource!",
