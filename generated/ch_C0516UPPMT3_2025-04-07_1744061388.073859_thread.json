      "message": "Improvement request: Add ability to rename configured data sources (drives, inboxes, etc.)\n\nCurrently, we're unable to rename datasources. Being able to rename data sources would not only add flexibility (as drives/sources & their initial purposes evolve through solution development) -- it would also address a pain-point:\n• Pain point example: After going through varying levels of administrative/operational steps to configure a drive, users might find that they need to rename it, for example, to something else (or maybe we don't want 25 sources all called `Amazon S3`  :lil_nervous:)\n• The only way to do that currently is by restarting the entire drive config process and making sure to name it correctly from the beginning -- and users must also consider that their name can't be updated once created, so it should be relevant in the long-term. \n• Being able to easily rename will make these pain points a non-issue\nRelatedly, if we can't always see/update the name during the config process (ie naming is a point-step in the config process), then the next best thing would be to make the drive-naming step the LAST STEP of the config flow (instead of the first step.)\n• I think it's usually easier to name something once you've finished setting things up & you also don't have to go back and rename (though the main request to be able to re-name in general would address this, too) :slightly_smiling_face:\n• CC: @Jason b/c we chatted last week about process/flow feedback improvements, including this one, around configuring datasources.",
