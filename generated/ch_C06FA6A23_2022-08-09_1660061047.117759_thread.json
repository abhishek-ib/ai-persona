I verified that I can run that command from the api-server-apps directory on 22.07 and launch the server, but on 22.08 the `gevent_server` flask command doesn't run, it just runs the setup pieces of `manage.py` without actually launching the server. The provisioner script and `start-local.sh` use a different command to start the flask server so they still work",
