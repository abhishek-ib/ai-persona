Jenkins will run every other hour (1PM PY2 unit tests run; 2PM PY3 unit tests run) — thanks @will and @Heymian for the help!\n\nRemember to setup your venv correctly so that in your Python2 venv, python is Python 2.7, and in your Python 3 venv, python is Python 3.6. See the transition guidelines: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YxMHM6KoPgLDaUUUKtaC3ju5bxF8aXeGMVmXQK7INSc/edit# for how to do this (it will link you to the relevant Getting Started Guide section)\n\nComing up:\nAll regression tests must pass in both PY2 and PY3 (we will enforce at UAT-time)\nWe will start to run a py3 dogfood instabase.com (http://instabase.com) instance (with help from @Ashish and team) — and thanks @Handsome Dave for converting all the Dockerfiles so we can actually do this!\n\nPlease reach out for any questions or challenges you have with maintaining PY2 and PY3 compatibility in your tests and mypy",
