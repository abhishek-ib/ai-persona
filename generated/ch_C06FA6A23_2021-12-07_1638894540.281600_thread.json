      "message": "Hi, I'm running into an odd case, debugging a solution I built with a customer on their deployment which is the April release (21.4.0). We have a flow that we do not want to force image OCR, and thus we uncheck Force Image Ocr and Write Converted Image Ocr in the OCR configs.\n\nHowever, we found that on the April release, the docs are still being OCR'ed, whereas in a different instabase sandbox (version 21.10.0), when the same settings are applied it works correctly and there is no OCR occurring. It doesn't seem to matter what OCR config is passed...any ideas what is happening/what we could fix besides upgrading the deployment version?\n\nPosted this to the flow slack, but wanted to post it here if that's not the appropriate group",
