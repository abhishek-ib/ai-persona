      "message": "1. I get the thinking now! For me the confusion comes from the fact that in a project we are only assigning a 'test value', which is just a placeholder. It requires the user to think a step ahead to understand the point of this i.e. its not about the dev app, its about a generic value so that we can use the same app in Prod later. This is not intuitive (but I agree its important)\n2. I think tool-tips or something should help here. I noticed the name of a secret also has to be Pythonic, but if I have a space I'm not told why this isn't allowed. The 'why' for these failures is quite important",
