I compiled my finds in this case study (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/x/GQABjw) doc explaining what happened, root cause and how we can prevent these errors in the future!\nThanks!\n\nPS: The guide contains some intrinsic details around AWS concepts and terraform which can be a bit obscure to some folks, I tried to cover the scenerio in details, please feel free to reach out to me for any question (and also suggestion how to make the case study better :smile:)\ncc @HH @abhitaker @sudeep",
