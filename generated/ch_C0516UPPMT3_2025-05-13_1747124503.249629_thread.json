I've scheduled us some time on Friday to internally chat before speaking with VRSF next week (time and date TBC).\n\nFor point 2 - they will be able to share a screenshot next week but essentially at the bottom of the chatbot window, there is a \"suggested prompts\" section that seem to have been autogenerated by the chatbot in relation to the current conversation. These are then clickable for the user to ask the question. EPD ticket here: https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-4366\n\nFor point 3 - I mentioned that we do not provide answers to anything outside of the chatbot knowledge base but they suggested at wanting stricter rules in place. One for us to explore further with them\n\nFor point 4 - exactly that, they want to pass answers from a first chatbot into a second chatbot that has been given a compliance officer persona to conduct a round of checks",
