      "message": "Interested to hear the answer. I assumed the mode switcher in projects was the only way to upgrade to 2.x, and you'd therefore have to create a new app version.\n\nIs it actually possible to update _existing app versions_ from AI runtime 1.x to 2.x? I would have thought too many changes were involved to the underlying project to support direct updates of app versions.",
