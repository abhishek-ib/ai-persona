See an example here:\nhttps://www.instabase.com/apps/ocr/review-doc/ib_solutions/solutions/fs/Instabase%20Drive/poc/moodys/ADM/kerry-test/data/out/s1_process_files/Al%20Madina%20Insurance%20Company%20SAOG-25.pdf.ibocr?i=0&ibflowresults=\nIt seems that all the words and numbers are read correctly, but how they are layout in the text file is completely wrong. I remember seeing this behavior a long time ago in DHL’s POC (upside down documents not layout properly) and thought we fixed it already.\n\nWe are using Google OCR for Moody’s POC and have a demo next Monday. While this is only one of their many documents sent to us, it’d be great if we can get this fixed soon…",
