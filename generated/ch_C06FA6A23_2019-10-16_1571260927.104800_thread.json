Py3 tends to read more things as unicode, and that seems to not play well with the default docker lang setting. this blog post kind of explains it https://webkul.com/blog/setup-locale-python3/. I noticed a couple services (ocr-service, webdriver-tasks) do this in their dockerfiles. if it's something all services need, can we add it to the base image? cc @Ashish @dlluncor @Handsome Dave",
