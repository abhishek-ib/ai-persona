      "message": "Good to know @Hari! Are those done in UDFs using OpenCV or something else? If im not mistaken, I think Assurant was interested in understanding what Instabase can do in terms of image preprocessing but without relying on code / script. So I think the OCR flags from here (https://instabase.com/docs/reference/apps/flow/step-config-reference/process-files/) are fair game. is there anything else outside of UDFs?",

Also we have lot of UDFs we used in different usecase that gave good improvements and we are consolidating then into the platform as part of the H1 roadmap.. right now all these are available in some form of UDFs.. they dont have to do any development if that is what the ask is...",

Let's confirm with @Hari just to be doubly sure\n\n@Hari Have we done any post processing as part of the digitization step (i.e. _Process files step_)? You mentioned Preprocessing, then we have OCR, but is there any further activity that we can do or have done after OCR but before _merge records_ step or _apply refiner_ step? Just curious to know.
