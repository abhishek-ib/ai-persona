      "message": "Weâ€™ve tested and introduced the required changes to allow OpenSearch, as an alternative to ElasticSearch. This would be relevant for AWS environments, where we can leverage a managed service (https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/?nc=bc&pg=wik) to avoid self-hosting an ES cluster, and has been requested by customers like SC, GS. More details about this change and what is supported are in this document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gwpKmhcqWmQWtFO0K0hTXtj0SZh1CR2AS19n3HnM1Zs/edit). This change has been added  `release-21.10` onwards.\nTo take this forward, would need some help in identifying the relevant pieces of documentation that need to be updated/added to highlight this as an option and the deployment process involved.\ncc @Aakash Tewari @raghu @sudeep\nThanks!",
