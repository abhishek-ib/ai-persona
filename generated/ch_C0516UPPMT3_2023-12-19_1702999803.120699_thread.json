      "message": "Thanks for sharing the feedback, @Bas ! Very interesting indeed. \n\nWe have discussed maintaining conversation history across prompts previously, and are actively exploring that initiative right now. eg after you get the net sales table, next prompt could be - ‘now calculate the CAGR from 2018 to 2023 net sales’ and we should be able to do that. \n\nThe interesting nuance here is the scope of chat history. With ‘threads’ idea that you proposed, the scope of next few prompts is fixed (similar to cleanup / validations of a field in Build), while in chat history we are looking at maintaining a larger history of both previous prompts and answers. \n\nDefinitely worth chatting about more, @Hari @vineeth @Sławek Biel",
