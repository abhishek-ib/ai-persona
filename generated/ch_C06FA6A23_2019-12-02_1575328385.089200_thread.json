They have never had this type of pass through model on their containers. They are getting all the right stakeholders involved to get something moving. Basically what they see is a short term and long-term legal plan.\n\nSomething to get us going initially that may be a bit harder (like having some sort of amendment we would need to have our clients sign that choose Microsoft OCR) vs a longer term which would be some formal larger agreement in place.\n\nThey will get back to us in the next few days with next steps as they internally get everything collected and the right stakeholders involved.",
