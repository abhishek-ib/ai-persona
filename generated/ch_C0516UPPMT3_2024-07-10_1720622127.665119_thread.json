      "message": "hi team! As someone who doesn't use AI Hub every day, I wanted to share some initial feedback on the changes to the new UI.\n1. I love the new look. The top section in particular with the cards flipping through is great!\n2. I was confused with the lack of \"converse\" wording on the page. @Orlando let me know that \"chat\" is where I should go for what we used to call converse, but i assumed \"chat\" was chatbots\n3. Now that i have started a project, the \"get started\" section has gone and been replaced with \"recent\" - i'd prefer to see \"recent\" and \"get started\" so i don't loose that shortcut to start building\nOthers who don't have the IB knowledge you all have, may have the same thoughts when they see this new UI for the first time :slightly_smiling_face:\nScreenshots below to show what i mean",

      "message": "For 2:  Thanks for sharing! We went with \"Create a chat\" since that's the action the user wants to do v/s open \"Converse\" (the app name). This is similar with \"Create an app\" which actually opens Build. We're aware that existing users may take a while to get used to this and we'll keep an eye out for feedback to make sure users don't get stuck here. For new users and once existing users get used to this, we hope it's more intuitive :crossed_fingers::skin-tone-5: cc: @Orlando since you had mentioned the same.",
