      "message": "Hi team,\n*Customer: SocGen development phase, led by their partner Arondor.* \n\nArondor raised significant concerns on behalf of SocGen about API stability and predictability. SocGen is building a downstream integration.\nTheir core issue is the lack of a formal policy on how we handle API versioning, deprecation, and breaking changes. They feel that relying only on release notes is not sufficient for their planning and development cycles, and this is impacting their confidence in building long-term solutions on our platform.\nCould you please provide some insight on the following:\n• *Existing policy:* Do we have any existing documentation (even if internal) that outlines our philosophy or rules on API versioning and deprecation?\n• *Versioning strategy: w*hat is our official strategy for API versioning (e.g., ap`i/v1api/v2`) and how long do we commit to supporting older versions after a new one is released? from my previous experiences working with other SaaS, we would very rarely change or retire API calls; and we would do it as part of the API versioning with very long notice. \n• *Deprecation notice:* What is the standard notice period we aim for before an endpoint is fully deprecated? The partner's concern was that a two-week release cycle offers very little time to adapt if a change is only in the notes. \n• *Internal feedback*: How do we manage API changes for other clients when we build integrations for them? \nThe ultimate goal is to create a clear, client-facing response that reassures SocGen, allowing them to build on our AI Hub with confidence.\nHappy to discuss further here or set up a brief chat this week to align on the next steps. Thanks!\n@subbu @Swathy N",
