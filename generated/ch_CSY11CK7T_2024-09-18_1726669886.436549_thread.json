It would also help me with another thing I'm working on, which is to run `server-nginx` on port 80 in crafting sandboxes, and let Crafting do the SSL termination.\n\nExample here (https://ppy-server-nginx--mattfichman-instabase.instabase.site.sandboxes.run/) (this is running on `ppy start aihub` inside my Crafting sandbox, with a local DB).",
