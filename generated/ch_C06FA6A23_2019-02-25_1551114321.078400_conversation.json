      "message": "Would appreciate some advice on where to store some information:\n\nA couple of people have had the suggestion to make it so you can \"pin\" repos. I'm trying to figure out where to store the information about whether a user has a repo pinned. I was thinking in should be part of the `RepoStakeholder` model as something like `has_pinned`, but I'm not sure if it fits the concept of a \"stakeholder\" since you already have to be a stakeholder to have a repo pinned. Was also considering storing a list of repo ids on the UserProfile but that seems like it could get messy. Am I going in the right direction or does anyone have a better suggestion of where it should be?",

(The former of which is east to change, the latter harder)",
