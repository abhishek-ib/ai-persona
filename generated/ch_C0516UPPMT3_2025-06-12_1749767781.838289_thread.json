      "message": "PFR: add ability to move pages by page number/class grouping\n\nI just got off a call with Velocity Mortgage, and their workflow during a run review requires moving some pages from non-continuous class splits together, often across tens of pages in between.\n\nIf moving just involved clicking the \"Move pages ^\" button as fast as possible 66 times, then it'd just be annoying.  However, each time that button is clicked, the front end needs to sync the change with the back end and wait for a confirmation from the db that it worked, which means that a user doing this might take 30 minutes just moving 1 grouping of pages, an unrealistic amount of time to expect from a human reviewer.\n\nI can see plenty of other customers also facing these kinds of issues.  There's no technical reason that a page move must go through all the intermediate 65 steps in between, *so can we add a button to the UI that allows the user to type in the target page number where they'd like it to be moved* to (30 in the case of the screenshot below)?  This way, the FE and BE sync operation only needs to happen once, and the user could complete this task in a matter of seconds, instead of 10s of minutes.\n\nFurther, the FE allows the user to click that button faster, even if the sync of the change hasn't quite populated through to the BE DB yet, resulting in sync errors and potentially corrupted files in the DB.  Besides this request for a better ux to perform this operation, *the FE should be adjusted to not allow the user to click that button faster than it can stay synced with the DB*.",
