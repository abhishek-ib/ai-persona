      "message": "hey team, when adding S3 as a data source in AI Hub, we specify `None` as the default SSE type - can this please be updated? customers are thrown off by this as a default when it comes up. all S3 buckets are created with at least `SSE-S3` as the encryption type by default (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html), so it seems the `None` type is not applicable. with AI Hub being an enterprise platform, we shouldn't support non-secure anti-patterns for data access.\n\n```All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically encrypted at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the default encryption configuration for every bucket in Amazon S3. To use a different type of encryption, you can either specify the type of server-side encryption to use in your S3 PUT requests, or you can set the default encryption configuration in the destination bucket.```",
