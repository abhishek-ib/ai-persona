      "message": "Ah okay, I see.  So those GPTs will actually play the game with/for you.\n\nThis is not a new concept (I believe https://aidungeon.com/ has been around since GPT 3.0 or possibly even earlier), and the idea has been talked about with some fervor within the TTRPG community.  Some people think it's a fun thing to play around with, while others have strong reactions against it (probably also because it's rumored that Wizards of the Coast [the biggest company in the industry, but also a company with a lot of baggage] is rumored to be developing an official version).\n\nI haven't played with these types of bots extensively or lately, but I'd imagine the experience would be even better nowadays with better models (perhaps ones that even generate relevant art or maps to compliment the gameplay).  I think it's cool that the Discord poster was able to spin up (seemingly easily) several different customized personalities/specializations to play with, instead of relying on whatever the devs of AI Dungeon had prepared.\n\nA challenge within the TTRPG space is that the role of Dungeon Master (DM)/Game Master/Facilitator/Judge/etc. is daunting and time intensive so DMs are relatively rare and some groups have trouble finding anyone to run games for them; AI DMs can help address this problem by filling that role or perhaps just filling in for the DM when they don't know what to do or say.  However, one of the biggest draws to the hobby is the unlimited creativity potential and the way that it facilitates analogue collaboration between people, so people might not be ready to embrace AI DMs in large numbers just yet.\n\nFor certain groups+game types, like play-by-post (asynchronously played in a chat platform like Discord), an AI DM might be palatable, but I think the approach with more widespread appeal would be to lean into the \"system of insights\" use case.  If our system can help quickly answer questions and resolve rules disputes, it would lower the barrier to entry for becoming a DM and even for new players, which I believe is a solid value proposition as-is.",
