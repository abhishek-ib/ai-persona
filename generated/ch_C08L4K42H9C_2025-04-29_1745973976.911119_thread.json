I looked into the code a bit and I believe the issue stems from this block of code (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/b4d1796e69931c3dfd985aeef834840af31e5f7c/shared-utils/py-utils/ocr-client-lib/src/py/instabase/ocr/client/libs/ibocr.py#L4486-L4493). Do we know what the behavior should be if `bbox_confidence = None`? Should we set the confidence to 0 if we aren't able to define it?",
