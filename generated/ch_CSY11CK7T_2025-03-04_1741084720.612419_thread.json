      "message": "Hey team - A blast from the past here I'm sure - But NatWest are upgrading from 24.01 to 24.07 and their Ops team are complaining that the colour has changed on their classification labels and they are concerned that the change will impact the pace at which they are able to review and won't sign off UAT pre-upgrade. Although a short term pain, they want to know if we can change back to the colours before (I said this is very unlikely). They also want reassurance this won't happen every time we upgrade them. Although this isn't relevant as we're moving them to AI Hub soon - I think it is useful feedback to share, as even something as simple as a colour change can impact the Ops teams use and efficiency of the platform.\n\nSo:\n1. Why did the colours change post upgrade?\n2. Are we able to change it back?\n3. Do we have the same colour coding in Ai Hub classes in human review - and do these remiain the same with upgrades?",
