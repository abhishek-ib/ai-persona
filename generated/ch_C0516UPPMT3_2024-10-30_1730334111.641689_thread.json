      "message": "I think it would be useful to show some visual marker for the drives/data sources you connected in the data sources dashboard. (Or some way to see the name of the member who connected it, either one). I personally would find it helpful in our internal environments but I can also see it being useful for customers. E.g. if you’re part of a shared workspace and multiple members have connected the same drive type using similar non-descriptive names (Google Drive, Google Drive 2, etc.) — it might take some time to figure out which one is yours if you wanted to disconnect it. A minor convenience.",

Implementing this would require adding a new column to the `mount_points` table, which should be straightforward.",
