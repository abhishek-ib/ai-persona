      "message": ":thread: *GitHub Reference Cleanup*\n:important: :blob-wave: :zap:\n<!here> Hi!\n\nI hacked up a quick script to gather up some git repo details to try and clean up some oooooollllld references and such.\n\nFor starters, here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IAZBdPjKemo243vr5LeDfzIsaEGo2jWv2uRrRpcxDc/edit?usp=sharing) is a report of all branches and tags+releases found in GitHub as of yesterday evening.\n\n:bar_chart: *High level stats*\n1. Tags: *971*\n    a. Released: *573*\n    b. Unreleased: *398*\n2. Branches: *1,654*\n    a. With >= 1 PR: *1,389*\n    b. Zero PRs: *265*\n    c. Protected: *143*\nMore specifically, the first sheet has all branches and any associated PR(s), along with the state of any PRs that were found, alongside the author's email and the last push date and a *Resolution* drop-down.\n\nThe second sheet has all tags and any associated releases present in GitHub, along with a *Resolution* drop-down.\n\nIn both sheets, the options for *Resolution* are:\n1. Retain\n2. Delete\n3. Unclear\nThose are pretty self-explanatory, but if you have reason to add an additional option let me know.\n\n:white_check_mark: *The Ask:* Please review the branches and tags in the linked spreadsheet and update the *Resolution* field to whatever is most appropriate. If the appropriate resolution is deletion, feel free to do so in GitHub, just be sure to update the field in the spreadsheet too! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n:exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:  \"*Unresolved\"* *items default to \"Delete\"!!!* On the cleanup date, any items that do not have a *Resolution* selected will be presumed junk, and consequently deleted.\n\n:clock1: *Cleanup date:* On *Monday, April 7th 2025* I'll be rerunning my scripts and cross-checking against the spreadsheet's *Resolution* field for each object type, and executing any deletions as defined in the spreadsheet.",
