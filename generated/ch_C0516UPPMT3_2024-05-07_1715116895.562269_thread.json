Only after a while I realized that I subsequently have to click on “run sample file”. Could we change that such that it runs when I click on the sample file? And maybe some language that tells me what to do (eg “click on sample file to see sample outputs”).",

One thing we’re exploring is to create a regular Wordpress page and have the sample file view in a iframe or otherwise. The objective would be to create something similar to this page https://nanonets.com/ocr-api/invoice-ocr (https://nanonets.com/ocr-api/invoice-ocr), which has a “try it now” if you scroll down a bit. \n\nWhat you are describing for the sample output, would that still work in this scenario? An alternative is to skip the iframe and simply mock it up in Wordpress design (ie fake it entirely).",
