While we should be correcting the disinformation being spread through the company, restricting an entire business line because of this is a slippery slope.  We should just let the business areas inside SC decide whether they want to use Instabase or not.\n\nThis is the kind of opposition we’ll see at other companies as well, where we’ll end up competing with internal products & teams.  We need to ensure that we set up the correct precedent.",
