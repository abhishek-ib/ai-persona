(this one: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLa7GkGGDhUzYpIdziUpRA_XoCbM6OGvU43U8_H3sU4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.auud2ybuxlx8)\n\nMy idea is that we can have an agentic-configured connector which will generate a code and walk the user to get all API keys, etc.\n\nE.g. customer can said:\n\"I have documents on my google drive, for each of them we need to download some extra documents from API and related doc from azure -> together they will be 1 packet\"\n\nOur agent will look up how to connect to an API using public docs and maybe python libraries, ask for all API keys which is needed (and point where to find them) and create UDFs which will do an integration based on the prompt\n\nWDYT?",
