I have a couple of small feedback points I wanted to raise though.\n\nThere is some inconsistency with the 'Edit Chatbot' buttons. The one in the sidebar takes you to the edit chatbot details screen, where as the one at the top takes you back to your original Converse project. Loom here (https://www.loom.com/share/798f08d4e9db416cb328a15f11b5e5e6?sid=41dbd93b-4e36-4fe9-9ed6-1218f2db636e)",
