      "message": "Re: #2, yeah the stance was that converse may mainly be useful in context of creating a chatbot. I'm not sure it's 100% true though, most people today use converse as a playground to explore a set of docs. We should consider an entrypoint for \"new conversation\" too. I was recommending this in context of the Search homepage too - Entrypoint for BYOD Converse - Google Docs (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OzUCT5ro1jNKa6n3DrPicbKH2viZ0WV-XOaSbKCo5DM/edit#heading=h.5ldw66g9aq56)",

      "message": "Thanks for this feedback! A few things:\n1. The reason why we default to all workspaces is that we will have other personas such as solution ops workers that need to monitor all deployments across all workspaces and reviewers taht need to review documents across all workspaces. We'll wait to get more feedback here before making any big changes. In the meantime, I definitely hear the concern around not remembering the last active workspace when you return to this view and have noticed this as a pain point as well. (@Xindi Xu @Jessica we should look into this one further). \n2. We are trying to establish the paradigm of build project -> app, conversation -> chatbot as the value of both build and converse multiply when a customer creates reusable assets that can be used at scale. The new homepage will be designed to ensure consistency with the new layout such that the entry points there map to creating a new app/chatbot and deemphazing build/converse as studios. We can definitely get more feedback on this as well as we start to roll out these changes.",
