I have inspected a quarantined webapp pod that runs on nearly 100% requested CPU, and it seems busy waiting/deadlocked. Based on what we understood, this likely is caused by grpc having issues with gevent, which we recently confirmed with the grpc team. We do have a plan to mitigate this and I will share that later in the channel.",
