      "message": "Hey everyone, another debugging tip - we've seen some really odd behavior on version 84 of Chrome. It seems to be a particularly buggy version and because we can't get to the root of those bugs we can't really fix those in instabase. I'd recommend everyone check their version of chrome and upgrade if necessary, and if you see particularly mysterious UI bugs at customers that you can't reproduce, check their version and have them upgrade too.\n\nExamples of bugs include Studio crashing when opening projects and laggy animations after opening new browser tabs - two seemingly unrelated but equally mysterious bugs!",
