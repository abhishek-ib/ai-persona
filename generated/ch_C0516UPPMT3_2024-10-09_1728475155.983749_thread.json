      "message": "Here is the POV use case they are demoing next month:\n\n<Outside of AIHub>\n1. Pop up a search text box for a user\n2. Using pre-built indexes of document archive and the user's passthrough auth, perform the search and return the documents in the search\n3. Create the conversation in AIHub for that user with the documents\n4. Once status is complete and all documents are uploaded, pop the user over to AIHub in a conversation\n    a. These folks would love an update where in the conversation creation, they can pass the document as well as the original URL of where they got the document from.\n    b. It would be useful to refer to documents already existing in a mounted drive in the conversation creation call\n<In AIHub>\n5. User interacts with individual and all documents to ask questions, get summaries, and otherwise analyze the content.\n6. If a document is in a foriegn language to the analyst, they would like to be able to set their desired language in the conversation and click a button to see the translated-in-place content.  Would be neat to have this in the doc viewer part as a button in the header like where the OCR output vs. image selector is.\n7. When looking at a document, the client would like their users to be able to see and click on the original URL so that they know the actual source.  They also asked if when it was clicked, we could \"pop up the document in an iframe\" so that they could see it but not be taking out of our main view.\n\nThis feels very much similar to enterprise search, but in this case, the client has already pre-built indexes, no content ever gets deleted, only additions and metadata updates are made.  Part of the metadata could be re-calls of previous messages which should then be ignored unless explicitly requested to use recalled documents within a timeframe.  No one should ever have access to all documents or even know what other analysts are looking at.\n\nSome system requirements that they need to be true:\n• Customized retention policy.  They plan on deleting anything older than 2 weeks old.  Can we use the IB Drive retention configuration in an offliine deployment?  Can it be set to completely remove not only documents but the whole conversation and its existence?\n• Users should not be able to know about each others' conversations.  Ideally, even the workspace admin would like to not be able to see the conversations added for users.\n• In creating the conversation for a user, that user might not even be in the system yet.  This could be their first time in AIHub and the shell account would be created through OIDC SSO once the user is redirected.  It would be great if the conversation could be created using an id that they absolutely know.  Since email is unique and will be something they have from the user login in the first place, it seems like that would be a good parameter to pass in on the conversation creation instead of user_id.  Alternatively, knowing exactly the character substitutions we use to get to uid will be required to be implemented in their automation.\n• <future> Enterprise search seems to do most of what we would want, but we would need to work with their locked down indexing with no crawler and always pass the search using passthrough auth from the user.\nWhat they would like",

I'd suggest creating a doc with the scenario + asks to coordinate a plan/create roadmap initiatives for each of these as needed with the owners\n\n1. Get \"passthrough auth\" for a logged in user in their system to impersonate them on AI Hub. Some of these users may not be on AI Hub yet. - new ask @Heymian @hannah \n2. Query AI Hub search using API from their system leveraging 1 - @margaret.tomaszczuk don't think there are plans for search API?\n3. Create chat using API from their system and get link to chat to push them over leveraging 1 - available if you get a token for associated account :white_check_mark: \n4. Ask queries of docs in chat created in AI Hub - available :white_check_mark: \n5. Auto translate doc to desired language - new ask @Hari @jayasooryan \n6. Retain source info for docs uploaded to chat and render in chat - new ask\n7. Doc retention policy across AI Hub - new ask @Heymian \n8.
