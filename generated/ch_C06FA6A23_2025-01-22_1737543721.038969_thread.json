      "message": "We're also noticing that the exhaustive search queries are taking too long to respond in the aihub-sandbox. Here's a a trace of one of such a run: trace (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/jaeger/trace/453f3d0b41c78c90).\n\nNotice that:\n• `Core-Platform-Service.GetAllMounts` is taking 9 seconds\n• `IndexService/GetItemPerms` is taking 23 seconds\n• `IndexService/GetItems` is taking 19 seconds\nThese queries are much faster in a separate sandbox that we have. The exhaustive search uses a knowledge graph, so the GetItems and GetItemPerms are being called with a lot of documents (max 512). Based on the conversation with @abhijnan, the GetItemPerms are sending stat requests to the datasource and the latency is expected. But what about the other two? They are supposed to be DB queries and should be faster?\n\ncc: @Balaram",
