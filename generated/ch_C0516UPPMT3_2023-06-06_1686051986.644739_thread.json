      "message": "Hi team, I am finding issues with results when loading a Waybill PDF. Converse understands that there are 2 packages being sent, when there is only one. When i screenshot the waybill and repeat the questions on Converse with the jpeg version of the waybill, it gets the answers right. I understand from some of the team here that its because PDFs have hidden text behind them, but i think this is something we need to solve. As a non technical user, i didn't know that, so assume the product doesn't work. It also doesn't work to tell people to screenshot and try again - not user friendly. Is this something that can be fixed?\nSee image for incorrect Converse answers when using the PDF version. (note, i have censored this image after the screenshot was taken)",
