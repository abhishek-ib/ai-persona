      "message": "Hey all, I'm working on some changes related to executing AWS Lambdas, with this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67093/files). I'm trying to figure out how to test it and was wondering if I could get some help.\nSo far, I tried recompiling everything on crafting and running it but it doesn't seem to hit the code (tested with print statements above where we're assigning secrets to `SafeString`). Instead, I provisioned a new sandbox on https://sandbox.console.instabase.com/sandbox in 2 ways (difference being platform vs aihub). In both ways, the following advanced params were present when creating the tenant.\n```{\n\"IS_ST_AIHUB\": \"False\",\n\"ENABLE_LAMBDA\":\"True\"\n}```\nIn platform one, I cannot seem to access AIHub which seems to be expected? - https://redact-secret.internal.instabase.com/\nIn AIHub, Argo CD fails but I cannot pinpoint where it's failing. The endpoints are still up so I can create a project, but the secret value is not redacted.\n\nHere are the repro steps:\n1. Create a secret on AIHub (/settings/secrets)\n2. Create a project on AIHub\n3. Add a validation UDF, and add secrets in the UDF (Show Keys > Secrets > Add Secret)\n4. Print the secret (`print(keys['secrets']['alias'])`)\n5. See redacted in UDF Logs instead of secret value assigned in step 1 - this doesn't work and want to debug why\ncc @raman.goel",
