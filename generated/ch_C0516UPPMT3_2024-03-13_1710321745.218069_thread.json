      "message": "Hey team, I've been using custom validation functions in Build and wanted to raise a couple of feedback points for things that surprised me.\n1. When a validation test fails, we return back an error message e.g. `return \"Error: the company has been dissolved.\".` This message is displayed in the human review screen, but does not appear in the logs while testing the validation function. This means I have to add additional print statements to my function for debugging to figure out which one of my checks the validation has failed on. I'm not sure what the definition of 'logs' is, but it would make usability better if the validation result was also displayed in the logs (or the table above logs). \n2. When I add a validation rule, they always start counting from 2. I.e. one validation rule, means it will be named rule 2 (instead of rule 1) - which I find confusing.",
