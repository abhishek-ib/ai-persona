      "message": "Hey @Heymian - I wanted to follow up on this.  Is there a way to \"edit\" or resolve users?  I am encountering a lot of folks who land in purgatory (no token, admin didnt create the account).  Unless I am missing something, if they create an account themselves, users are pretty much permanently stuck.\n\nCan we disable the standard \"create account\" button on the landing page?  I dont entirely understand when you would actually want to use that...  Or can we provide admins some control to approve users / change emails / resolve issues?\n\nTypical Scenario:\nI have a sandbox for enablement, we get some user who was unexpected in the session.  I have not created an account for that user via admin, and they do not use the token.  In this scenario that user has burnt their username and email address.\n\nI created this ticket, but im not sure if i filed it correctly. https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/CS-2367",

Can we provide users a link to the login url with a token, or otherwise help them get unstuck?\n\nAlso, when would we ever want to use the account creation without the token?  Could we just disable that?\n\nThanks.",
