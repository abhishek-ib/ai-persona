I tested this out signing up with my personal email and it still shows all of this information. What can we do to make sure this isn’t showing? (cc @wadams)",

If you type in JPMC it shows everyone's name and emails. From a security standpoint these corporate emails (albeit only used for sandbox training and their documents wouldn't have any proprietary information) is still considered personally identifiable information so unless it's explicit that it's being exposed to other people outside their organization poses a security risk for us.",
