      "message": "Hi all, just fyi I made a new (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/49762) make command `make run-test-local-no-mypy TEST_NAMES=...` that basically does `make clean build run-test-local TEST_NAMES=...` but without mypying all the files, which can take several minutes. I think some of us have been just commenting out the part that runs mypy but now we can just use this new make command :slightly_smiling_face:",

So running `ibtest` for tests in `api-server` doesnt work, but running `make run-test-local-no-mypy` will work in `api-server`",

      "message": "So the issue mentioned in Xindi’s post there is no longer an issue. `TEST_NAMES` should work always work with `make run-test-local`. The reason for that was the `run-test-local` cmd in specifically api-server and app-tasks was incorrectly getting overridden to workaround/skip some tests in the system-test py-util module. That has since been fixed.",
