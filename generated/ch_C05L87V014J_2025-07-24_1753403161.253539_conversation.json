The immediate problems are solved as far as I can tell -- however, I've heard that some folks are still having trouble with their sandboxes.\n\n*If your sandbox is broken:*\n1. Pull master & rebase\n2. Resync your sandbox & rebuild the base image\n3. Suspend, wait 1 min, resume\n4. Check <#C05L87V014J|> for solutions (search backwards)\n*If your sandbox is still broken:* Please reach out to me directly, with these details:\n1. Clear description of the problem\n2. Logs\n3. Direct link to your sandbox\nFor US-based folks, I'll have office hours tomorrow from 9am-5pm EDT -- any free slot on my calendar is free. Please feel welcome to put a 10-15 min block on my calendar.\n\nWe really want to get folks unblocked ASAP. Thanks!",
