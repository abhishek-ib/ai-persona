Also just curious what the need to make edits/review in app runs are? Is it to generate runs to use in ground truth sets? We want to move users towards using deployments and doing review when needed through human review",

Once you're done editing, there's no clear way to exit besides going back, which is not ideal especially if you're unsure if the data saved. Also, I can open this view from a deployment run, not just an app run. If we give the user the option to edit data in this view, then we should give them a good user experience navigating this page, which I think the button enables. What's the reasoning behind pushing them towards deployments again?",

      "message": "Got it on point 1, we can try making the loading indicator easier to see and also possibly adding some sort of clear Close button when users are done viewing results cc @Natasha we should think about these pages with the new navigation as well.\n\nDeployments are to be used when we want to run apps in production essentially since they offer extra features like integrations, metrics, and review. Apps can be reiterated to improve them through Build and so users do have to view the results of the run but other than editing the values for a ground truth set, review and editing fields should not be done on them. I understand the UI and UX is not really expressing this since it allows users to make edits and mark runs as reviewed at the moment and we need to fix that. cc @jack.robbins Lets make a clear action plan after offsite to address this.\n\nThanks @david.lee",
