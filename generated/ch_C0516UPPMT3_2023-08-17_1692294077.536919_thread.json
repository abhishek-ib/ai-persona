      "message": "So I may of spit balled a cool idea with Wells Fargo Customer Service team today around audio call behavioral analysis. So this is actually two folds, they have massive amounts of auto transcripts that they want to process. We leveraged a sample one in AI Hub today and it absolutely crushed the sample transcript in what they wanted to see out of it. So that was sweet. Heres my idea that they fell in love with, Customer calls agent, agent is getting a bit out of line with their tone of voice and we alert based on audio transcript and tone to the agent they need to change their tone or the way they are answering the question. Sounds like this is a massive pain in customer service. So my ask, have we seen any audio behaviour analysis models out there we could potientially test out.",

Since we have the advantage of already being onboarded at these banks, my guess is we could beat these other startups to the punch with half the functionality. \n\nThey need 3 capabilities\n• transcription audit (ex saying something to a customer that is a complaince violation)\n• the functionality to prompt operators live based on how call is going\n• call transcript summarization",
