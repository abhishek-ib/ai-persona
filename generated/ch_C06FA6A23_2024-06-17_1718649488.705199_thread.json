      "message": "Agreed, converse is a lot simpler in terms of DB fields so it would surely make things easier to manage!\nTo understand the scope of the proposed change better, a couple questions:\n1. Are we thinking of creating like one parent table with all the common fields and the converse and build table will just inherit that & implement the fields which are specific to them? OR just 2 separate tables for each app? If it's the former than we could think about the search_projects table as well along the same lines.\n2. Are we going to keep the same endpoints active (atleast initially), handling the table switch in the accessor layer itself?",
