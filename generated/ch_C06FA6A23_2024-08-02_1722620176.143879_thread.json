      "message": ":thread: Mesh Manager Config Patching Issue\nThere has been a recurring issue where if the mesh manager configuration is patched, any subsequent changes to the config are not applied because the older patches take precedence. This has led to multiple system failures, deployment rollouts internally and with customers.\nFor example, during the 24.01 rollouts, VMAgent (a new addition to platform) caused multiple SaaS pipelines to fail across various environments because mesh manager config did not get updated, and the solution was to delete the patched mesh manager config. Recently, NWM had to roll back their production environment after a major upgrade, and it was discovered that their mesh manager config had also been patched.\n\nWe need a strategy to prevent similar issues in environments where the mesh manager config might be patched, either intentionally or accidentally.",
