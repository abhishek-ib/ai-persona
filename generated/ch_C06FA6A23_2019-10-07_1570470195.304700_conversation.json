CustDev folks, please make sure anything that _has_ to go into the Oct 21 release is represented on the release board.\n\nBring any potential risk items to this meeting, and we’ll reconcile. @Eng, whatever’s on the board at the end of the meeting will be considered committed. @CustDev, whatever’s _not_ on the board will not be delivered. If you’re an eng team member working on something you know a customer needs that doesn’t have this visibility, please check in w your leads.\n\ncc: @Ted @dlluncor @Ashish @paul @georgia chestnuts rust-ing on an open fire",
