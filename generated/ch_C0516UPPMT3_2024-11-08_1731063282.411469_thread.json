      "message": "Hey team, just got off a use case deep-dive with ANZx and ANZ Mortgage Origination teams. They had a variety of questions + feature requests that I've taken away to find answers to. Can I get some help confirming answers to the below?\n1. 'How can teams collaborate inside one project' - EPD-2808 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2808?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZmIwNjU4NDliNTc5NDUwZmEzNzVmOGRjZGY3YzNlY2MiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), EPD-1223 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1223?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNjg2OWJiYzliNDQ2NGMwNDkwNTRiMGUyYzVkNGM4MTciLCJwIjoiaiJ9)\n    a. Any timelines for these @Kaustubh (KD)?\n2. 'Can we do GitHub style integrations for projects'. Particularly they were interested in PRs, managing changes etc for projects. - EPD-1223 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1223?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNjg2OWJiYzliNDQ2NGMwNDkwNTRiMGUyYzVkNGM4MTciLCJwIjoiaiJ9)\n    a. Does this need a separate? History + version management is becoming a very common request for Enterprise customers @Kaustubh (KD) \n    b. Any idea on timelines or how much prompt histories will cover?\n3. 'I'd like to pull/push metrics into the Deployments dashboard, to or from other systems. Particularly I want pub, sub and scrape kind of end points' - EPD-3173 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3174?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYzY4NTIzMjJmMTIyNGQ0YjkwOTNmNGNlNGQ1NWY4MDEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)\n    a. @jack.robbins do we expect this anytime soon?\n4. 'How can we cross-validate across documents in AI Hub without PS support?' EPD-1857 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1857?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZWZjMmJhZDNhNDRjNDJiYzhhMDI2YzY0Y2JlMjIxOGQiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)\n    a. @Kaustubh (KD) any projected date here?\n5. ~'Does the webhook activate upon a review action? E.g. I get one notification on job completion, do I get another each time a document is reviewed? Only when batch is reviewed?'~\n    a. ~@Anil maybe the best person to help me here?~\n6. ~'How do split-classified files appear in the API output?' @Anil~ \n    a. ~They were interested in whether outputs we linked e.g. nested results inside file name.~\n    b. ~Also wanted to know if they can link back to the underlying files (I assume that has to be via their mounted S3 bucket)~",

So unfortunately cannot provide a timeline yet.\n\n2.   GitHub style integration can be quite involved, I think for these the earliest version of version history is https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2939 which is a stretch item for Q4.\n\n4.   We will have cross-class validation coming with Case management. This is likely Q1 in terms of being a deliverable.",

It would be helpful to understand specifically what they're looking for though to see if it could be built into AI Hub.",
