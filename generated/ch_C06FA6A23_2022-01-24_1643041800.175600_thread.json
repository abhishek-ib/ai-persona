      "message": "I'm planning on creating a util function of iterative approach for json.loads() (python) using existing open source library such as ijson (to get rid of memory spike by sacrificing performance). We noticed json.loads() will create a memory spike because it tends to take 5-6x memories for large files during load, and even more memories for smaller files. When we `json.loads` a 60 MB file, it can spike up to 321 MiB (according to my memory profiling), which may crash docker container with tight memory margin. It seem like an issue that had happened in the past as well. Have anyone looked into this in the past? Is there any value to try to get rid of memory spike?",
