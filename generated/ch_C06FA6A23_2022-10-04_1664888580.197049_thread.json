UAT's controlplane database has also been migrated to the same Postgres instance.\n\nThere was a minor hiccup with the network egress policies for the Postgres port (5432) (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/31292), but I got it sorted.\n\nI'll continue to monitor, but everything looks stable!\n\nFor controlplane folks: I'll going to hibernate the old controlplane mysql database to ensure it's not being used anymore. I'll keep the instance around for a week or two as insurance.",
