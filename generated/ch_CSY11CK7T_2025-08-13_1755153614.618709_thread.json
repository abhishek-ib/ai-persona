      "message": "Hey Team, There is unique request from one of our customer, requesting if there is way to get the table or any detected object directly instead of writing a prompt for it in field description. For instance if the UI shows as table that got detected, is it possible to get the data directly by detected object rather than going back, creating a table type field and then writing a prompt for it in field description(video explanation attached). Reason they asking for it is, most of the time prompt are not extracting them the whole table if it is spread across multiple pages.",
