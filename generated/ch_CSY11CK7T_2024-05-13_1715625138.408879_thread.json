I was chatting with @shaunak about this last Friday, we both think that turning on Cypress pre-merge is a big milestone. We are fully aligned on having people prioritize time to address cypress issues right now, because we believe having robust integration tests is so important for us and will save us a lot of time in the long term. This is truly a cross-functional effort from frontend engineers in every team to release engineering and crafting. Please let Shaunak and I know if you need any support from us, feel free to tell your manager or DM us directly. Thank you again, I feel quite confident given all the progress in just a week; I think we are close to the finish line.",
