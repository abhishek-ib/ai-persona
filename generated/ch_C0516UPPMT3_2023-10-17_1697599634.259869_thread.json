      "message": "Love the new AI Hub docs layout, I think it's much more readable now compared to the previous half page view.\n\nWe can look into further improving the designs so it's seamless with the AI Hub's design\n1. The color schemes do not match with AI Hub. The primary color for example should be violet (#5A52FA) instead of the platform purple (#8463CE). Other colors in `note`, `info`, `code block` can also be tweaked for the AI Hub theme.\n2. Spacing in some elements can be improved (increased) - the top navigation breadcrumbs, vertical spacing in table of contents, vertical spacing in expanded side nav items?\n3. Color change feedback on hovering clickable elements in the side nav can be added.\n4. Usage of higher weight text (bold) - I feel like the usage of bold in docs is not consistent with AI Hub. In AI Hub we use size and color more to differentiate the hierarchy instead of bold, it helps in quickly scanning the page. Example (https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/docs/aihub/converse/index.html).",
