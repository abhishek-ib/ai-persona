Seems that my issue was in the folder itself.  One of my files is a weird format i didnt catch.  It would be nice if we called that out though... \"your folder contains a `.webp` file... this is not supported\" or if it uploaded the other files and just failed on that one.  Either way, the folder works now that I've fixed that file",
