Something that is an array of objects that defines each section of a result:\n```[\n   { type: 'TEXT', display: \"This is the table outputted\", value: \"This is the table outputted\" },\n   { type: 'TABLE', display: <markdown table>, value: <nested array> },\n   { type: 'OBJ_LIST, display: <markdown table>, value: <nested array> },\n]```\nThen we can render this out item by item with formatting as is needed. This is just a first pass at the idea, but it would be a universal format that all UI’s could manage.",
