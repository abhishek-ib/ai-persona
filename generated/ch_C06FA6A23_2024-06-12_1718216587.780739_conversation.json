      "message": "Hi everyone, we reached a big milestone last week: we have completely migrated to the Post Install V2 framework :tada:. This was a long running, multi-team effort. We've already reaped massive benefits from the more debuggable, runnable, and flexible framework as evidenced by a big jump in the success rates of our weekly SaaS deployments. Post-install started at a roughly 45% success rate and now hovers around a 96% success rate. Complete post-install success is not uncommon with 6 of the last 9 weeks passing the actions stage cleanly. I'd like to thank everyone who lended a hand:\n• The action owners for taking on the individual migrations, keeping up with bug fixes, and putting up with my nagging: @mfichman @Jeff @Victor Zeng @pauline.comising @Sayd @Dominic Fannjiang @Anurag Mudgil @Aayush@Adam @Pridhvi Vegesna @Xindi Xu \n• The managers for helping to push and prioritize the effort for H1 @jtau @Rakesh @lydia @Heymian @Kerry  @shaunak @andy @Aaron Tami\n• The SRE team for putting up with the pains of v1, the transition period to v2, and help with recording issues encountered with each stack @Aaron Tami @jayapandian.ponraj @Parvez @puneet @sanjay.gk @abhitaker @shikhar @Rahul \n• @William Helmrath for taking on the UI changes for v2\n• @Kerr Yoo and @William Helmrath for working on the helm implementation of post-install v2\n• @Kai for the v2 argo implementation, and for lots of help with cluster networking and mesh manager\n• @Arek for counsel on getting the DM Upgrade flow migrated\n• @shiqi for help with image repos, permissions, and pipeline changes\n• @sean.donohoe and @Cody Boggs for help with the new image builds added to our stack\n• And an amazing intern from last summer, Pleng, who dove in head first with post-install and has been checking in on the project despite being back at school\nPost-install is an integral part of our upgrade and install process, handling automatic platform setup, data migrations, and platform testing that reduces many of the otherwise manual actions required to get Instabase up and running. As always, documentation is available on confluence (long (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CP/pages/2079162413/Post-Install+Actions+V2) and short (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CP/pages/2107768875/Post-Install+V2+Quick-Start+Guide)), and <#C05SW8HK3S8|> is open for questions and suggestions. We hope to continue making improvements to the user experience of adding and managing actions and our ears are always open for feedback. If you've got ideas for more deployment/upgrade automation at IB please reach out. Thanks all!",
