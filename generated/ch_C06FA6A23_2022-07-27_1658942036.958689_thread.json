      "message": "Hi team, Citi is asking for a few detailed items that require Eng input:\n\n1. How is data (PII) is handled during model development in ML Studio. Specifically, what is transmitted during the API Service calls, which data are cached in Celery? *If it's all metadata, we need a detailed attestation of all steps in writing* (which might require legal?)\n\n2. How do we secure our Bitbucket pipelines, i.e. what guardrails do we have to ensure no rogue person intercept or replaces project components? Can we validate through certs? Citi expects a env variable that specifies location of additional cert authorities for validation (e.g. mount cert auth using k8s and provide path to where cert is mounted, IB goes to that location, validates it signed, current/not expired etc.). How difficult would it be to embed this validation?",

For example, do we properly handle PII when reading/writing to file service.\n\nWhen do you need this by? it sounds like it will require a decent amount of work, and I also wonder if we have existing documentation around how PII is handled on our platform cc @Kerry @shaunak",

Frontend UI actions in ML Studio go to “API service” and don’t contain PII.\n    a. Calls go to api-server-apps and api-server. The API calls and responses pass data about the document (e.g. what words were annotated for “name”). This does send PII back and forth - it’s required to display the document data to the user and to save the annotations.\n3. Caching with celery - do you mean how Celery stores the async task result?",
