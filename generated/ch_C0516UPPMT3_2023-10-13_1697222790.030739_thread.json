      "message": ":rotating_light:Positive Feedback:rotating_light:\n\nThis channel is named feedback, so chiming in here with some awesome AI Hub results!\n\nContext: we have a potential customer (Checkr - top 5 background check company globally) looking to buy a tool by EOY for employment & education verification. Every time employment & education can’t be verified automatically, the interviewing candidate has to send in documents to verify they worked or went to school where they claimed they did in their application. *These documents include; W2s, Paystubs, 1099s, Schedule Cs, Diplomas, Transcripts.* \n\nThey sent us 58 documents (many of which were extremely blurry, all the way to completely unreadable). I built an app in ~5 minutes and sent 50 docs through; initially getting 96% classification accuracy (caveat being the two it missed would’ve needed to be flagged for review anyway - attaching below for reference), 80% field-level accuracy, & 50% automation rate.\n\n*After spending some time tweaking the app with different complex prompts, I was able to get:*\n1. *Employment docs (higher volume) - 95% FLA | 87% automation rate*\n2. *Education docs - 87.2% FLA | 67% automation rate*\n*Why is this so awesome:*\n1. I built & tested this entire POV myself in a single day’s worth of time, using their documents. If I can do it, anyone can \n2. FLA's were great OOTB, but what's going to be most exciting for this customer is automation rate - ~9/10 of their highest volume docs could be fully automated!! Given the complexity & redacted fields of the education docs they sent, I’m impressed we managed to get to 67% on those as well\n3. The ability to improve accuracy this much simply by tweaking your prompts is fantastic. I think we’ll collectively get better at figuring out what prompts work best as time goes on, which means improved accuracy & automation\n*Shouting out the entire EPD team for the extreme pace of development & improvement of AI Hub. You all have fielded the waves of feedback in stride and it shows in the growth of the product (_4 weeks ago when I first tested this the FLA was maybe ~50%_). I owe every single one of you a beer (just let me close Checkr first pls).* \n\nI also want to shout out a few folks specifically:\n@Kerry - your willingness, availability and enthusiasm to field & help solve any and all issues has been amazing. Thank you for troubleshooting AI Hub with me at 12am (everyone else - please don’t reach out to Kerry to troubleshoot AI Hub at 12am). Absolutely fearless leader!\n@Clemens @hannah @Bastiane - all of you have jumped head first into customer calls with me and been integral to the progression of these deals. The enthusiasm and acumen that all of you bring to calls is invaluable, I couldn’t do it without the support from you all. Thank you Hannah for 7am customer calls, Bastiane for jumping into fires at a moment’s notice, and Clemens for generally just crushing every demo & customer question that we’ve gotten (it is so so impactful to have a senior exec willing to jump onto these & help run them)\n@Arjun - when I proposed a weekly sync I don’t think you fully understood what you were getting yourself into, so thanks for not cancelling it yet. You’ve been a perfect thought & design partner, who has been nothing but receptive to suggestions, feedback, and imaginative brainstorming. Thanks for teaching me how to Eng & answering all of my questions along the way",
