      "message": "Hi team, @Hamish and I had a disco with Vitality Insurance (https://www.vitality.co.uk/)  - no immediate ask but sharing details for signal on case management functionality.\n1. Prospect: Journey Director and former CPO (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-priestley-03224813/) having been at the company for 20 years - focussed on automation.\n2. Inbound lead - referred by someone (he couldn't remember who)\n3. Use Case(s): Quoting and Membership management\n    a. Problem statement is the same for both: Emails coming in from brokers with multiple attachments. There is a set number of fields that need to be extracted from the email and its attachments, although the data can come from any of the documents.\n4. We have next steps agreed, and they suggested a simpler use case to begin with, although the above is the immediate use case they're looking to solve for \nAny questions let me know. Thanks!",
