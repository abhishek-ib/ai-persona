      "message": "Hi team, wanted to surface this issue: we prevent creating a copy of a Project using an existing name, however, this check is only on the frontend, we donâ€™t validate this on the backend, and by intercepting and modifying the api request, you can create multiple apps with the same name in the same workspace, leading to app publishing conflicts down the line. Relevant ticket (https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/9128) (probably, still confirming root cause, but can make this occur locally and seen in screenshots).",
