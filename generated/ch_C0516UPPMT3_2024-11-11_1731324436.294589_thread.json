      "message": "Hey, I have various questions / feedback on the AI Hub APIs based on customer requests:\n1. When documents are split-classified, in the results, the sub-documents are not provided with a name/id that matches the UI (see attached response)\n    a. I can't see any way to easily connect which set of results comes from which file. There are no page numbers given, and no names given to sub-documents (in some cases we see 10+ docs coming from a single PDF packet)\n    b. In the docs here (https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference/runs/get-run-results#response), it looks like there should be the keys `post_processed_paths` and `doc_id` . I don't see the former in the response, and the latter is null for all docs\n        i. Why are all result keys marked as optional in the docs? It looks like they are just all returned maybe? @jean \n    c. Can I link the results back to the split up PDF via e.g. connected drive? What if I'd like to download the split files and results to store/use somewhere (e.g. customer is recreating HR screen)?\n2. When I make edits to results, I can see what results have been changed to, by whom, and when. But the original extracted value is missing (needed for audit purposes)\n3. I can get a web-hook notification on run completion. Can I get another one once review has completed?\n    a. Is this part of the ticket for review notifications @jack.robbins?\ncc @hannah @Kaustubh (KD)",
