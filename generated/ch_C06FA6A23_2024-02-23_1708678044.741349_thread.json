Instead they are opting for manual upload of documents and reviewing the results. They have couple of questions related to manual upload & processing files through Instabase.\n\n1. Are there any doc, size or type limitations?\n    a. Size Limit: [https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C011FHLBN8N/p1656530585764429]\n        i. Single file can be of maximum 2gb\n        ii. Zip file can be of maximum 1gb\n    b. Supported Doc Types: https://instabase.com/docs/23.07/apps/reader/digitization-support/#supported-file-types\n2. Are there any special permissions required for the users who will be uploading and reviewing documents in Instabase?\n    a. Users should have \n        i. write permissions to upload documents\n        ii. execute permissions to trigger solution/binary\n        iii. read-write permissions to perform the review using Human Review screen\nDoes my answers looks good for the above questions?\n\ncc: @Nithin @amber @Paul @BG",
