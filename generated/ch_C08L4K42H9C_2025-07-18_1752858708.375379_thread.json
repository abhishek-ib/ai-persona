      "message": "Heyo, just to continue the conversation on prioritizing bugs and what that might look like :woman-bowing::skin-tone-2: here are the couple questions I mentioned if @prateek.tenkale @Weiming Wu or anyone else had more thoughts:\n• What kinds of bugs are reaching customers and staying unresolved for months/year+ (blockers, edge cases)? What types of bugs do you think should be fixed before it reaches a customer or  asap?\n• When do you have time to work on them?\nI ask because I've noticed a lot of the time my lower priority bugs end up in backlog forever in favor of feature development, so I'm curious to identify the discrepancy between when we can take on ticks vs when people think we should, in case there are other changes we can make beyond better quality testing",

      "message": "In my case, many of these bugs honestly didn't even have tickets with priorities assigned to them. I had to compile the list myself and sync with @jack.robbins separately to get a better sense of the priority. Some of the issues solution engineers had flagged previously but we just never got around to addressing it for some reason",
