      "message": "I've been working on creating routes for apps so that they don't need to be in a workspace - e.g., a route for Flow such that instead of having to navigate to `/apps/flow/jessica/my-repo`, I can navigate to `/apps/flow/`. I realized Notebook is a little different in that it brings you into the file system in your workspace where your notebooks are stored. I'm not too familiar with how people use notebook so thought I'd crowdsource different ways to make a workspace-agnostic notebook route. For instance, would it be reasonable to create an actual Notebook app from which you could open notebooks? Is there any functionality other than opening and creating notebooks we might want in it some day?",
