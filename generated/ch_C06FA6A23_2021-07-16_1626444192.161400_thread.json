      "message": "Hey Team, I'm currently investigating our capabilities to handle special characters/letters to prep for our upcoming initiatives in Central- and Southern European markets (Germany, France, Spain, ...).\n\nI tested both the Default (Abby) and the Marx OCR engine with a set of passports as well as with special purpose images that contained a lot of different characters.\n\n*Question:* \nThe `Default OCR` has a language flag option in the `OCR config` settings. When this is enabled it produces pretty strong results (see image below). It seems like adding at least a single language flag (like `de` for German) catches all the other language-specific special characters as well (French, Spanish) which is great.\n\nAs adding the single flag covers a much wider range of characters that might occur in our customers documents with no drawback in performance (as it seems), I think it would be beneficial to make the language flag a default OCR setting. It has the better out of the box performance and leaves no room for frustration in the case that a customer does not know how and where to activate this feature.\n\nLet me know what you think about this :+1:",

      "message": "Hey @Kevin!! Language detection is an expensive process, more lang code you add the OCR engine takes longer, for smaller docs you won't see much diff but increase will be evident with doc size.. Currently the default is set to EN. We can make this configurable based on customer deployment.. It wont be a big change.",
