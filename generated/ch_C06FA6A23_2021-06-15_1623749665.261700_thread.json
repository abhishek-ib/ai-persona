The ‘write content to a file API doc’ is good to explain how this can be done as a REST communication to IB: https://instabase.com/docs/reference/apis/filesystem/#write-content-to-a-file-api.\nPS: if that helps, I am meant to create a short video for Ben to illustrate how to use File systems APIs from post-man or standalone notebooks. Let me know if you’re interested.",
