      "message": "FYI, I am planning to merge a PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/33890) that will move all the functionality that api-server-apps provides into api-server and set the stage for eliminating api-server-apps. This PR itself will not mean api-server-apps can be killed. A few subsequent PRs will move all clients talking to api-server-apps and make them talk to api-server instead. Once that happens, api-server-apps can be killed. I plan to merge this PR soon. Let me know if anyone would like me to delay it a bit.",
