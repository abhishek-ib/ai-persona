This is like splitting up a word that's supposed to be written together (e.g. writ ten to ge ther). I tried cleaning up the table output but it hung for 3 minutes and failed..\n\nI turned off table and checkboxes to use the advanced OCR model and it worked much better. Still some excess whitespaces (SS5) that don't exist in the original document but it at least doesn't separate a single word. (for example, in Korean it should be written as \"publictransportation\" but it splits it out into \"public transportation\" - grammatically incorrect, but not a huge deal imo).\n\nIf we could digitize using advanced OCR it would be best, but then table extraction wouldn't be possible... @Raul Mächler",
