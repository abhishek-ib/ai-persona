      "message": "The “import from URL” feature in conversations doesn’t seem to work too well with pure Markdown content. Many sites (our documentation site included) have started exposing a purely Markdown version of pages, with the idea that it’s supposed to make it easier for LLMs to understand the content (https://llmstxt.org/). However, when I tried importing from the Markdown version of a docs page (https://docs.instabase.com/admin/assigning-roles/llms.txt) , in the process of generating the PDF it seems key information was stripped? None of the checkmarks in the tables came through (image and text version of the captured content attached).\n\nNot sure if this is just…how it works with PDFs, but if so it would be great to have support for importing Markdown in Markdown.",
