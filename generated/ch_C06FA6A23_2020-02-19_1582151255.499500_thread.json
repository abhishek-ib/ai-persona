Itâ€™s not immediately pressing, but will come up for them in the future. Is this on our radar?",

Our containers run on top of kubernetes which (can) run on AWS EC2 instances, but the creation, maintenance, and configuration of those instances is up to our customers. We do not - as far as I can tell, after grepping around in our codebase - interact with the old IMDS interface at all. This should be a no-op for us.",
