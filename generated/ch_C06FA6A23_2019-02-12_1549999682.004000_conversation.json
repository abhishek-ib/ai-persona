      "message": "Hey guys, when I did the file system I changed the loading to load all of the files in a folder instead of the user having to click at the bottom to load the next page of files, because I noticed at Citi that the pagination was making it really difficult to search for files. However, I hear there's been some long loading times for very large directories.\n\nProposed solution: we'll automatically load the first page, but instead of the having to click to load each next page, there will be a \"load all\" button that will load the rest of the files. Does that sound good, or are there any other alternative suggestions?",
