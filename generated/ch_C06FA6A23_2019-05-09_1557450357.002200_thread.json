      "message": "Sure, on a gloabal admin level there can be a site wide proxy, or sticking to the concept of a repo setting their can be a configuration for a proxy setting, or in specific app's (in this case flow steps) their could be an option. If I call a fetcher I could enter in my proxy details or set the Process files step to a specific engine that happens to be google vision or who knows. At capital one everyone was given a unique proxy URL (tied to their username) with a password. It allowed for us to configure specific software to talk to the outside world but at the same time be accountable for what we did (hence the tie back to username). However on production services we could request a global proxy setting.\n\nWhy I bring up firewall: When we deployed cloudera in datacenters we had to open up the firewall settings on multiple levels. Internal systems Capital One controlled and vendor's like Verizon who were/is our fiber provider to allow specific traffic. The way certain Hadoop services updated and orchestrated proxy wasn't an option or at least during that time.",
