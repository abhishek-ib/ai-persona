      "message": "Hey teamm :slightly_smiling_face: eod update is as follows:\n• :white_check_mark: Field extraction and digitization no longer hangs (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C08SC9ZPGFQ/p1757362748440449?thread_ts=1757358736.295599&cid=C08SC9ZPGFQ), as model-service was successfully brought up\n• :white_check_mark: Displaying table fields works (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0976HB6ZPT/p1757350817242159?thread_ts=1757345396.413339&cid=C0976HB6ZPT) for new fields and fields created before the fix just need to be re-ran\n• :white_check_mark: Split-classification batch `extraction failed` bug fix merged (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/74412) to master and should land soon\n• :loading_wheel: Bug bashing (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0976HB6ZPT/p1757351644142529) for auto-generate is underway and we'll have a better idea tmrw whether fixes can make it into Wed certify. The investigations are:\n    a. split classification is buggy right now with autogeneration due to some schema race conditions. Investigating fixes on both BE and FE\n    b. split classification FE intermittently does not display the correct classes tho on reload we see the correct classes. Jaden is currently looking into this\n    ◦ minor UI fixes w/ displaying autogenerate option when in legacy mode. Also FE that Jaden will get to\nlmk if there's anything I missed, and yep to confirm @margaret.tomaszczuk the GTM is recommended to work more with non-split class cases correct? I remember we made the split-class `extraction failed` bug non-blocking since it was only for split-class, so is the same true for these auto-gen bugs?",

      "message": "hmm i think the first issue in auto gen testing is probably related to that non blocker bug. I'm not seeing extraction failed errors for the whole schema, but seeing all fields being deleted due to race conditions sometimes and also we're not able to save fields in the extracted fields json due to some extra schema requests being made. cc @jaden that it's not a blocker and potentially weiming is working on this.",
