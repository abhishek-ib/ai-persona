      "message": ":tada: This week, we’re excited to announce the availability of _*Incremental Training of Models*_ that enables customers to improve model accuracy without requiring the original documents.  Data Scientists can now improve the accuracy of their models by training models with net-new documents.  Incremental training saves customers time and further accelerates solution development when used in conjunction with Solution Accelerators. :thread:",

      "message": "Data Scientists can determine the baseline accuracy of the imported model by evaluating it against new documents.  If needed, they can simply train the model with the new documents to observe a performance improvement. In order to incrementally train a model, the data scientist just needs to import an existing model into ML Studio, attach an annotation set to the model, and click “train”.\n\n_To get started_, access ML Studio in IB 22.11 and later. Documentation is available on Instabase.com (http://Instabase.com).\n\nIf you have any questions, please provide feedback in *<#C02KS5FHZEE|>*",
