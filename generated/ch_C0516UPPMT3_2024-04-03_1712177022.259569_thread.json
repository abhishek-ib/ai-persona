I ask because i am trying to run a converse multi-doc query to automatically calculate DTI within mortgages, and it keeps picking up the 2021 salary",

(when the year is specified, the monthly pay is calculated correctly from the right document) \n2. Your problem is in the first question \"where did you get his gross monthly income\" -- that the system is picking up the income from an older file (2021)? \n3. Can you share the query that you use to get the \"most recent income\"? It's probably not these two in the screenshot",

Correct - when it is doing the DTI, it needs to look for how much a person makes a month, to then bump against their debts. It grabbed the wrong value in this case\n3. The crux of the problem looks to be the issue of determining employment (attached query below). It is saying he's employed by Mesa, however he now works at FortisBC. If I ask for his current position, it is correct",

When given the time explicitly in the prompt (for example, \"what is Clyde's income in 2023\"), the answer is correct; if the time is implied or implicit, the model doesn't know. Correct me if I'm wrong?\n\nYeah it'll be an interesting problem to solve. Thanks for sharing the files! cc @Hari I think this is a knowledge graph use case, and @Varun Jain on search in general",
