      "message": "Hey team, wanted help understanding how to interpret the gemini response's `pages` key in `documents` since it's not clear to me from the prompt. Here are two example split class responses I'm getting:\n```# first - all pages of a class are together, non-contiguous\n{'documents': [{'class': 'W2', 'pages': [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14]}, {'class': 'Fedloan', 'pages': [3, 4, 12, 13]}]}\n# second - non-contiguous pages split into diff list entry\n{'documents': [{'class': 'W2', 'pages': [1]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [2]}, {'class': 'Other', 'pages': [3, 4]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [5]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [6]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [7]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [8]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [11]}, {'class': 'Other', 'pages': [12, 13]}, {'class': 'W2', 'pages': [14]}]}```\nSince the second example splits up non-contiguous pages, does the first response mean all the pages are in one doc? Since the response of `SplitClassificationRunner.run_on_file()` doesn't include fields, it's not clear to me which ones are treated as one doc to extract from",
