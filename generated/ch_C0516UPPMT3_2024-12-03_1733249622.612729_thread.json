      "message": "yup, add `autocomplete=\"off\"`.\n\n> should we add a `type=\"count\"` to disallow non-numeric characters?\nthat would be problematic for 3 main reasons:\n• `type` is an html-specified value & does not refer to custom layers on top an html input.\n• Adding `count` is a dangerous pattern which would bloat `Input` as we introduce more & more custom types\n• Custom types like `count` may benefit from / require different prop type restrictions which would get very complex if built directly into `Input`\nWhat you’re looking for is a wrapper around `Input` called `CounterInput` or something w/ its own restricted set of props & built-in validation.\nThat way I could also add storybook entries for each new custom input type that builds on top of `Input`.\n\nMight be good to discuss which types could be beneficial during Frontend guild to gauge how useful these special types would be",
