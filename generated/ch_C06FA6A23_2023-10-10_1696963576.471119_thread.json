Someone on my team ran into the same issue but it was resolved after rerunning CI. This error persists for me after rerunning.",

I did a quick code search and these are all very old code written years ago. @Jag can you make a quick PR that change all\n`# type: long`\nto be\n`# type: int`\nin the codebase (do a quick search and replace). Tag me as reviewer, I'll review and merge the PR.\n\nHeymain, let me know if you have any concerns? cc @shaunak here on potential CI problem",
