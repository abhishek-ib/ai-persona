In terms of bandwidth allocation for the infra work, we have someone joining the team in a few weeks who could help with this work. Does that timeline align with what we need for productionizing frontend observability?\nAdditionally, in terms of scope in Q4, do we want to focus on enabling frontend observability specifically for AIHub, or should we aim to cover all SaaS tenants?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts! c.c. @Serena @lydia @sudeep",
