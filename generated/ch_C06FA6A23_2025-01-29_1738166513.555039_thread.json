Heads-up that I'll be re-certifying the IB Platform (`-enterprise`) releases later today, potentially a few times,  working out an odd quirk in the pipeline. I'll post here with a big green checkmark when I'm satisfied the final certifications are clean and happy. :slightly_smiling_face:",

Also, I _did_ run the AIHub certifications this morning (a day early) to gather more details on some of the revisions and fixes needed in these pipelines that I'm getting prioritized and documented currently.\n\nThat said, you might not see the AIHub releases be *re*-certified today, but they will run tomorrow as scheduled! So if you have fixes that didn't make it before this morning's run on *AIHub*, no worries, they'll be included in tomorrow's run. :dancing-penguin:",
