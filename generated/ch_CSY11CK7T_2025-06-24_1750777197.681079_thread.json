      "message": "Ah for context on the change to app_id away from app_name and app_owner - since source_ctx was inferred by `request.current_context_name` (as seen in the PR), if a user wasn't viewing a public app in the same workspace it was created in, the incorrect source_ctx would be used to query the table for runs and come up empty since it doesn't match whats in the DB. Off the top of my head, a potential solution is to use app_name and owner like before for non-public apps and only using app id with public apps, if we can guarantee their versions are more finite which seems more in our control? ie maintain them by deleting outdated versions, but maybe I'm wrong",
