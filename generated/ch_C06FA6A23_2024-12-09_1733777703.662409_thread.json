I think he was waiting on your PR to upgrade mypy in one of the services? I would recommend model-service as a starting point, since we are more familiar with that one. How did the update go? model-service pulls in quite a few shared modules, so I'm wondering if that causes a lot of mypy errors.\n\n@sean.donohoe is it possible to use different mypy versions for model-service and ibllm (a module imported into model-service)? I'm guessing not?",
