      "message": "Team,\n\nA report from Money 20/20 in Las Vegas: We spent the last few days doing what seems like hundreds of quick, live AI Hub demos from our booth to a wide-variety of fin-tech companies, and AI Hub prod performed tremendously well the entire time!\n\nA highlight for me was when a CTO from an South American integrator was skeptical that our demo was rigged, and emailed me a messy social commercial contract (attached) in Portuguese, and I showed him live how AI Hub could easily extract all of the information he required and translate it into any language.  His mind was absolutely blown.  He signed up immediately.\n\nThis is just one example of the tremendous excitement the team (Kudos to @Will McDermott, @Andrew Sherrill, and @Aditi) drove over the last four days.\n\nAnother feature that had great demo impact was the API link that shows up after a solution is published in Build.  It was an eye-opener on how quickly solutions could be created and consumed at scale.   The future is bright for the Growth team as we continue to add more features!\n\nI know this channel is primarily leveraged to provide feedback on areas for improvement, but I wanted to take a moment to thank the entire EPD team.   We've come incredibly far and should remember to take moments to celebrate our progress.\n\ncc: @Kerry @Clemens @Anant",

Or maybe that's only a problem I've run into. :grin:",

      "message": "Thanks @Nathaniel! This is currently a bit of a gap. We absolutely can run drip campaigns, reminders etc, and we have marketing software like Marketo for that, which feeds from contact details stored in Salesforce. Now, the issue we have at the moment is that salesforce and ai hub are not connected - also most people sign up for ai hub via a freemail like gmail (hard to enrich).\n\nThis is something that is being worked on - ideally, we find a way to encourage people to sign up with their corporate / business email or identify/link themselves with a company, have it flow through into salesforce where we can enrich this data, and then use marketo to put them in automated drip campaigns. That has multiple benefits, including identifying single users that work at enterprises.\n\ncc @Varun Jain @Alex @Conor",
