Also can you share reproducible steps to cause this issue? Cause I can run `make clean build runlocal` from `webserver/api-server-apps` successfully, and I did pull from master today",

There were a couple of other ppl who also got the same error. \n\n@Dominic Fannjiang Can you first check in your dependencies folder (mine was in pyenv) if the foundation folder/files exists? If it does, you need to uninstall from pip because it shouldn't be using that one from dependencies. Our update python script doesn't uninstall missing packages. I think this is why your local is working \n\nIf you are indeed using the version bundled in our monorepo, check your build folder's structure for foundation",
