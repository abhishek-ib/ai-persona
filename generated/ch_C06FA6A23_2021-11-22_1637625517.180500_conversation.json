      "message": "@Aaron Vontell thanks for the post! All of the GTM managers have come together as of a few weeks ago to discuss, and we feel pretty good about some actions that we are taking in our organization focused on work/life balance. This difficult work/life balance for employees across Instabase continues to be the biggest piece of consistent feedback we get (across all orgs) and something myself and the rest of the executive team are focused on improving for all employees. I will talk with YJ about spending some time with the engineering team if helpful to discuss our findings.",
