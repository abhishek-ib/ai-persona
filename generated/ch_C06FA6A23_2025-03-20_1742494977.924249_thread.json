      "message": "<!here> Friendly reminder on AIHub Release support cycles to minimize incidents around certification, deployment, maintenance, etc:\n1. We support, at minimum, the *three* most recent AIHub release versions, based on our fortnightly / biweekly release cadence.\n    a. In some cases there might be more than three. The expectations here still apply to any release branches additional to the 'normal' three.\n2. *All* critical / breaking bug fixes that might impact any of the supported release versions must be backported to *all* supported AIHub major release branches.\n    a. It's not sufficient to backport only to the current UAT release version.\n3. To find the currently supported AIHub release versions, the authoritative source is GitHub's branches (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/branches/all?query=release-25) page.\n    a. Search for `release-25` (at least until next year :wink:)\n    b. Any branch that reads `release-XX.YY.0-aihub` *is a supported AIHub release branch* and thus needs to receive breaking bug fixes.\nAs a handy note, the current supported release branches are:\n• `release-25.06.0-aihub` (Deprecation delayed due to delaying incidents with 25.10-aihub rollout to Prod)\n• `release-25.08.0-aihub`\n• `release-25.10.0-aihub`\n• `release-25.12.0-aihub`\nPlatform Eng very much appreciates everyone working with us on the process pieces as we keep working toward reducing the toil on our team and others!",
