      "message": "Hi all - got a couple questions from an inbound (consultant who signed up for a commercial free trial on behalf of one of his clients)\n\n_1. Their key need is a chatbot to interact with some internal PDFs. I've made a prototype of this, but as far as I can tell, I'm not able to share it with them because they don't share the same email that I do. I'm a consultant for them. Is there no way for me to share a chat bot to an external domain or just publicly?_\n\n_2. The files that will power the knowledge base for the chat bot will need to be updated weekly. I understand that you have an API, but I just want to confirm - can I use this API to delete old and add new files to a chat bot? Or will someone have to go in manually each week to do that?_\n\nThanks for the insight, team!",
