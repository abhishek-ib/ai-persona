      "message": "Passport:\n• The app name needs to be changed to \"Passport\" to be consistent with the other apps on the marketplace\n• The description needs to be more readable. I'd recommend:\n    ◦ \"Extract information from any passport\"\n        ▪︎ To confirm - are all passports supported? Or just US? If there are country limitations we should include in the description. \n    ◦ We don't need to list all fields - this can be found by clicking \"App Info\" and looking at the schema. \n• The app icon needs to be a colorful icon and match the other icons for apps published to the marketplace\n• This app was published by *Smile Garg.* We need to recreate this app from the Instabase pubishing account so that the name displays as \"by Instabase\" when published to the marketplace\n    ◦ *@Adam* *@Travis* is there anyway to change this during the publishing step or does the app just need to be recreated with the Instabase account?\n• The application worked well, but the MRZ didn't extract great. I don't think this is a blocker for publishing, but we should look into how we might improve this.\n    ◦ Can we move the build project to a shared workspace? I don't have access to the project and wanted to take a look at the MRZ prompt\n    ◦ Going forward all build projects for these marketplace apps should be in a shared workspace\n• We will need to add sample files here before publishing. @Travis is this still blocked even for site admins?\nUS Drivers License:\n• Similar feedback here:\n    ◦ The description needs to change to be just \"Extract information from any US Drivers License\". We can remove all information about the schema. \n    ◦ The app icon needs to be added and colorful just like the others\n    ◦ We need to publish from the Instabase account\n    ◦ The project needs to be in a shared workspace so that it is accessible for other IB teams\n    ◦ We need to add sample files before publishing\n• For testing, I pulled the first sample drivers license off of the web and realized that we extracted the name wrong and we didn't get the gender. For anyone testing this app (who will likely do the same with the same test drivers license), it does not instill much confidence. Can we take a look at this?\nSeparate apps feedback:\n• When testing out I got a failure \"processing your files\" we need a retry button here that allows a user to reupload the files (cc: @Travis @Siya). Otherwise a user is stuck her and needs to refresh the page.",
