      "message": "FRB wants to extract the employee name and employer name using the w2 flow we delivered. The formula they’re trying to use in Refiner is `Clean(scan_below(INPUT_COL, 'Employee name', num_lines = 1 , e=2, right_pad = 30))`. I’ve told them that they don’t need to set e that high unless they’re seeing enough inaccuracies in OCR to warrant it. Beyond that, does this seem like an adequate refiner formula to do what they want?",
