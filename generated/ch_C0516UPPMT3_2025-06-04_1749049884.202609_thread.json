      "message": "Hi @Hamish, so as part of digitization process we convert each page of the pdf to an image of 300 DPI and specified quality setting, and in the end to generate the pdf we essentially concatenate all the images and overlay the text we extracted as a transparent layer on top of these images. This is to ensure that the generated pdf looks identical to the input one. Now,\n1. If the input pdf was a machine readable pdf, the size of the generated pdf would be considerably higher since we now have images in the pdf.\n2. If the input pdf was a scanned pdf, the generated pdf could still have a bigger size because of the DPI and quality of our generated images.\nThe DPI and quality setting we use is essential for the accuracy of OCR.",
