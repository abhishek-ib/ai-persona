For any cypress tests that you own, you can now link them to a testmo case via the automated testing workflow!\n\nThis means that *all cypress tests* *should be linked to a testmo test case* and should have the automation test linking — this will allow us to track the stability of cypress tests within Testmo itself. Please let me or @youngmok.cho know if there are questions around this — the goal is to have consistency for how we track our test cases and manage what is covered by automated test vs requiring manual testing\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C04TSMWLPAS/p1717786497616509",
