      "message": "Hey all, I was working with @Sayan and @Xindi Xu, and I think there is a problem with the `ibdev-backend` template where it is not setting `.basrhc` correctly, even though it's configured to do so. I have to look into it, but in the meantime, if you have problems with (a) `node` not running correctly or being the wrong version, or (b) the same for `python`, then please check your `~/.bashrc`. It should have the following content:\n\n```eval \"$(/usr/local/pyenv/bin/pyenv init --path)\"\neval \"$(/usr/local/nodenv/bin/nodenv init -)\"\n\nsource .bash_profile```\nI'll update the thread when I know why the template's version of `.bashrc` isn't applying to new sandboxes.",
