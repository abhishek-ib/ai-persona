      "message": "Sounds good.  I'll also point out that many books related to TTRPGs have copyright on them, so similar to how we probably couldn't publish a chatbot that answers questions about the latest Stephen King book, we have to be careful about what we publish.  Though I'm sure our users are well within their rights to upload copyrighted documents of their own, just the public publishing is the problem.\n\nThat said, many of the popular current games are published under an Open Gaming License, so their core rulebooks are freely available to the public and most likely safe for us to use in a public chatbot.  Some examples include:\nD&D 5th Edition: https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document\nPathfinder/Starfinder: https://2e.aonprd.com/Licenses.aspx\n\nThe PDF that I used on this last weekend was for the Rogue Trader game by Games Workshop, which I don't think has an OGL, so we might not want to publish this:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiO0vzTo593YJIDWVy-eRv_wA20lSlwz/view?usp=sharing\n\nSorry I haven't had a chance to look into Subreddits yet.",
