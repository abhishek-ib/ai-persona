      "message": "*Lengthy agent response in Converse:*\nI was working in `Converse` using a URL as an input file, and for one of my utterances, the agent's response was incredibly long + took a very long time to respond.\n\nDuring this time, I thought that the product was either broken (I couldn't see the output being built since it was being populated within a nested response block + I couldn't abort the response (my only two choices were to delete the conversation, or refresh the page, which removes the response.))\n\nFeedback:\n• Add ability for users to interrupt agent generated response without losing the entire response\n• Show embedded text/code block being populated during generation\n    ◦ I was only able to see up to bullet point `4` (screenshot 3, for reference, is what I was seeing and I couldn't scroll through the response to see the rest - which is why I thought maybe this was a situation of a runaway agent response)\n• What do we think about being able to download files from the projects only? (IE not able to download files from published apps or chatbots, but only from Build and Converse projects)\nLink to Converse project: https://aihub.instabase.com/converse/01910154-b3f8-77a7-8cc7-7abfadf57a38\n• Titled: `Feedback: long agent response`\nEnv: `Prod`\nLicense: `Commercial`\nProduct: `Converse`\nOption(s) enabled: `Non-latin character recognition` (not the advanced version)\nFile: uploaded via URL: https://www.oliveyoung.co.kr/store/main/main.do?oy=0\nModel: `Advanced`\nUtterance: `Tell me about active sales and promos`\nResponse (embedded portion of response truncated (`...`) since it's way too long to share in Slack):\n\"Based on the text from the document, here are the active sales and promotions:\n```1. **NIVEA MEN Sensitive Shaving Foam Double Pack (200ml+200ml)**\n   - Regular Price: 11,700 원\n   - Sale Price: 9,700 원\n   - Promotion: Sale and coupon available, \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n2. **Nightingale Daily Derma Cleansing Pad Mild (70 sheets)**\n   - Regular Price: 12,500 원\n   - Sale Price: 11,000 원\n   - Promotion: Sale and \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n3. **Nightingale Daily Derma Cleansing Pad Mild Acid (70 sheets)**\n   - Regular Price: 15,500 원\n   - Sale Price: 14,000 원\n   - Promotion: Sale and \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n4. **NIVEA MEN Sensitive Shaving Foam Double Pack (200ml+200ml)**\n   - Regular Price: 11,700 원\n   - Sale Price: 9,700 원\n   - Promotion: Sale and coupon available, \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n...\n\n71. **Nightingale Daily Derma Cleansing Pad Mild Acid (70 sheets)**\n    - Regular Price: 15,500 원\n    - Sale Price: 14,000 원\n    - Promotion: Sale and \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n72. **NIVEA MEN Sensitive Shaving Foam Double Pack (200ml+200ml)**\n    - Regular Price: 11,700 원\n    - Sale Price: 9,700 원\n    - Promotion: Sale and coupon available, \"오늘 드림\" (Today's Dream)\n\n73. **Various Kombucha Products by TEAJIN**\n    - Regular Price:```\n\"",
