      "message": "Howdy folks!\n\nNot sure whether others have felt similarly, but I personally dislike maintaining tutorials (especially ones which use a follow-along layout) in Confluence and GDocs. I was thinking that it would be really nice if we had an Instabase-specific mirror of something like Google's CodeLabs (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) and, as it turns out, this is very doable (see this medium article (https://medium.com/@zarinlo/publish-technical-tutorials-in-google-codelab-format-b07ef76972cd)). Especially under the context of us having Crafting available to dynamically provision various virtual machines, I think this could help improve onboarding/how-to guides and make documenting internal processes/knowledge less tedious\n\nWould anyone else find it useful if we had an internally-managed codelabs platform?\n\n(cc @Aaron Tami / @shaunak / @Heymian)",
