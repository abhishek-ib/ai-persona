      "message": "*Azure Sandbox PSA*\nWe introduced what I think is a breaking change in Azure Sandboxes for existing sandboxes upgrading from a previous release to 22.03 or later releases.  Please let me know if/when you are doing this upgrade and are unable to recreate your sandbox from scratch (e.g. customer sandboxes).  We made some changes to how the Azure FileShare is configured and mounted on File Service that will require some manual intervention while doing this upgrade.  I will work on automating this to make this upgrade easier.",
