Would be great to set up a short-track experiment! ^^\n\nWhat I like the most is this:\n> breakthrough came from the MUVERA paper. Instead of searching through all patch embeddings independently, MUVERA reduces multi-vector search to single-vector similarity using fixed-dimensional encodings. Think of it as creating a “summary fingerprint” that preserves the rich patch interactions while being orders of magnitude faster to search.\nMUVERA: https://research.google/blog/muvera-making-multi-vector-retrieval-as-fast-as-single-vector-search/",
