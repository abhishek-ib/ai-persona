It would be great to be able to port it to their own accounts afterwards. Our partners could do that to stimulate consumption, or get paid from the clients to do that for them.",

      "message": "We don’t really have any built-in features around App portability right now. I think the ideal end-state here would be to have an organization with the customer users in it. You would then also build the App and share it with that Org. If it’s not easy to recreate this right now, there’s a highly manual workaround where we can find the `.ibsolution` associated with this App in `system/global` in the FS and republish it.\n\n@fernando.piazza.ctr, can you ask the customer to add our commercial account to their org? Then you can share the App with them.",
