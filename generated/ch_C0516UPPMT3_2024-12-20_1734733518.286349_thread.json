We have received feedback that, despite the change to `gpt-4o-mini` there are still several tasks that this model struggles with (see ticket for more details (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3154)).\n\nWhile we think this is generally an improvement, this is a change to the AI Runtime (the collection of model, pipeline, and system prompts), and it means that there will be some behavior change. Additionally, there will be a cost change; if we make this change derived fields would be priced as advanced fields. So we wanted to get some feedback from the field/raise awareness.\n\ncc: @Hamish + @david.lee",
