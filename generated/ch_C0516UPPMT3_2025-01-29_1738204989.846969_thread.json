      "message": "Two points of feedback about Validation prompt generation:\n1. It seems like the validation function generation takes into account not only the Validation Prompt input but also the field definition. In SS1, it shows that the validation fail message returns `\"Claim Number must be in the format 'C' followed by 6 digits.\"`. My validation prompt simply says `\"Claim Number has 6 characters\".`  My field definition (SS2) has the part about starting with \"C\". Is this by design? I think this could be problematic\n2. This seems basic but the generated function had the field name snake cased with all lowercase characters (SS3), which caused an error, since my field name was title cased. Doesn't matter which one changes but we need to keep them consistent. It worked when I changed variable names",
