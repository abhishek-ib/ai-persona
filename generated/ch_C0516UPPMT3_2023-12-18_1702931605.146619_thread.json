If I start a project named “Insurance”, publish an app with the same name, and then at a later time change the project name to “Banking”, the app that it publishes will still be stuck with the initial name it was given (in this case “Insurance”). I only bring this up because a few times I’ve lost track of what project builds to what app.",
