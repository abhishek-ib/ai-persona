Instead of taking the previous response and putting it in a table format, it generated summaries for all documents in the knowledge base. Then, when I corrected it to refer to the first query, it responded about Apple's revenue in 2021, which was not ever mentioned in this chatbot's history. This is the link (https://aihub.eu.instabase.com/hub/apps/8e757bdd-ff41-4b70-a243-6d62fc503dc5) to the chatbot",
