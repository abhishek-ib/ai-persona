      "message": "@Dominic Fannjiang ideally we should provide a mechanism to have `TracedThreadPoolExecutors` which can have tracing support out of the box. I have created a JIRA (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/OBS-1012) to track this.\n\nFor now to enable tracing across `ThreadPoolExecutors` you can use the following steps -\n1. Pass the current active span to the child thread you want to use tracing in. You can get the active span using `tracing_utils.get_active_span()`\n2. In the child thread use the parent span passed earlier to activate tracing. You can use `tracing_utils.activate_span(parent_span)`\n3. Now you can use all the tracing functions like start_span etc in the child thread.\nCan you please try out this approach and let me know if you face any problems.\n\nc.c. @sudeep @raman.goel",
