      "message": "Hi there, want to continue discussion on the point I brought on today backend case field meeting.\n\nMy question was:\nâ€¢ If we imagine our system 1 year from now (or if we redesign it from scratch), would we still want to have 2 of everything? (Like UDFs for single class and for cross class, validations for single class and cross class, prompts for a single class and cross class...) Or should we think (and implement) about them as a same functionality which applies to a different scope for different fields?\nIf I redesign our system, I'd probably have scopes, each one included in the next one: EXTRACTION_SCOPE -> CLASS_SCOPE -> DOCUMENT_SCOPE -> PACKET_SCOPE and allow dependencies only on lower scope (or lower level of a current scope). With that execution of a workflow will be a rather clean one: do calculation and validation for each scope in the order and it also will allow us to parallelize calculations and validations for each scope layer.\n(Note about layers: we can calculate layers inside a scope during app compilation and build execution using Dijkstra-like approach and failing if we have circular dependencies instead of relying on the field position. Also cleaning for a field will be in a separate (next) layer from the field, any dependent fields will be in at least next layer, all validation will be on the very last layer)\n\nI believe this will allow us to simplify API and implementation a lot\n\nWDYT?",
