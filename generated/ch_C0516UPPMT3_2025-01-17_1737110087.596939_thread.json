      "message": "This is happening b/c the results table is actually 2 separate scroll containers: 1 for the column headings & 1 for the body.\nWhen you horizontally scroll on the body it’ll trigger a scroll event on the headings to adjust their position. The reason the headings can’t trigger a scroll is b/c they have overflow hidden which is necessary to avoid a double-scrollbar.\n\nThe proper fix here is to use a single table w/ full-width rows for the class names so there’s a single scroll container.\n\n@Serena Migrating to `TableGrid` will take some time but would ultimately fix a lot of the awkwardness we’re seeing in this table & hopefully improve perf since it’s horizontally virtualized. Any opposition to this approach or does this ticket require an immediate quick fix?",
