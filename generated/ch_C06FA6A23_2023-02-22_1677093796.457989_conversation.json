This label is automatically added on Patch Professor runs and automatically removed when applied. You shouldn’t need to manually add any labels for Patch Professor to work anymore. The Patch Professor docs (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1847918652/Patch+Professor) has been updated to reflect this new process.\n\nPlease reach out to me if you have any questions or encounter any problems. I’m always happy to help!",
