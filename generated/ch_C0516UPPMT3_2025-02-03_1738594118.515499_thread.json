      "message": "Hey team, I've been asked to qualify a use case for Deloitte on timesheets (shift work). They've passed me these two sample documents, and I'd hoped visual reasoning might be able to help with the handwritten corrections. The task is to extract the tabular data with the handwritten corrections implemented. Table extraction does a decent enough job with the table, but handwritten corrections (e.g. swaps, cancellations, notes) are proving tricky.\n\nMy current position is that we should qualify out as I am not getting promising results (https://aihub.instabase.com/build/0194cb90-bc8a-749e-8943-00db36a54798). Any ideas?\n\ncc @jordy.vlan @Kaustubh (KD)",

      "message": "Oomph, rather tricky use-case: table with small print + handwriting. A current downside to our vision reasoning pipeline is that OpenAI only allows us small control over the resolution (either `low`  or `high` ), which does not work well for these examples.\nClaude should allow us to control the resolution better, so maybe test in some playground (https://claude.ai/new) if it does any better?",
