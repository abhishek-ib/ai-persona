It’s just a weird choice for a formatter since it allows varying ways to satisfy rules and isn’t as deterministic as I’d expect a formatter to be. \n\nBut also not worth the time to worry about, I’ll just disable my formatter to avoid the inflated diffs and deal with the failed commits while yapf changes stuff. :joy:",
