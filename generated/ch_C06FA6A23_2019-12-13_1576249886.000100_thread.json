It seems like discussing/deciding on a release date would be a key part of a release weekly meeting. Perhaps in Monday's release weekly, we can come in with all the necessary customer information (contract deadlines, requests, engineering time estimates, etc) and reach a decision then.",

      "message": "Hey @lydia :wave: I think we will have more clarity on the approach for BAML on Monday which can help inform our decision to push the release or not. \n\nTo be clear, we have not told customers we are moving to a quarterly cadence. Iâ€™ve asked customers if they would prefer that but we have not officially communicated that we are moving to that model yet. My customers would prefer it.\n\nThere will be a transition time to get the quarterly releases that we need to account for. I think step 1 is determining if BAML pieces can even get complete if we decide to push the release back a few weeks - this is what we need to figure out on Monday",
