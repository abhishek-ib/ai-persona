We started to draft an answer (just waiting for clarification above on operations disappearing)\nre: YAML - the customer was really focusing on the YAML file itself as they will be using it. They said that they got a version where custom keys are not mentioned - why would it be different from the docs (as you mentioned they're interdependent ).\n\n@Anil Deprecation notice => are there any future improvements we are working on and we could share. e.g we're working on a 12-months supported LTS we will let you know once implemented. - without promising anything, it would be good to share something.",
