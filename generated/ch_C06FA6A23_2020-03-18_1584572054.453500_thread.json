      "message": "Hey folks :wave: to add the customer perspective to what @Matt shared above, most customers today use the following apps only: Refiner, Classifier, Flow, NLP Search, Diff Checker, OCR (although, not sure this should be an app), and Review (not really an app but the review page).\n\nHowever, in their contracts, we list out *every capability in Instabase as an App* (Bank of America example here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uFtHB0ihZLCwHogAVB4REQAOJ4a1-XEumU7-lDVUQVI/edit#gid=0)). This is very challenging because we have to provide a description for that app and if the app doesn't meet the description and expectation for the customer we *often get held to custom development for a feature that we don't have plans to work on* in the roadmap. We want to avoid having to do custom development because of a legal commitment to a term so that's why we are creating the category language.\n\nWe want to better categorize and clean up apps/functionality that are or are not useful to customers. For example, when we roll out Refiner 5 with complete visual extraction logic and table extraction logic (later), we will likely deprecate Visual Refiner and Table Refiner since customers will be able to everything they need in Refiner 5. However, today we cannot do that easily because we list the app name in the contract without any language that says we may merge and remove apps later on. By changing this language, we can avoid maintaining apps that no longer make sense to support.\n\nAt the same time, we should clean up some apps and features that are not useful to customers. There are *apps that don't have any active development/maintainers or plans for future development* so we need to decide if they should continue to be available to customers or not - for example: data manager, sequencer, lens, viz. If I'm incorrect, and someone is actively maintaining these apps, let me know as I've been asking about this for a while (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/GSA2D4GR4/p1578003947003300).\n\nAll apps that are in the production category should have a development or maintenance plan, otherwise we should recategorize them. All apps in beta should have a plan to move to production. If an app no longer makes sense to maintain in production (because customers don't use it or the functionalities are merged elsewhere, we should recategorize as deprecated.).\n\nWe all need to work together to decide which apps should be considered production and beta (flag them and create maintenance or path-to-production plans) and which apps we should continue to maintain vs deprecate.\n\ncc: @Ted @Jesika Haria @Jessica @Ashish @dlluncor",
