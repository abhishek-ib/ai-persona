      "message": "*Search Feedback*\nHad a quick play around with search and a couple of feedback points that came to mind:\n1. Ability to cancel a query would be useful\n    a. Others have said this - accidental mistakes in the prompt happen often\n2. Provenance within the returned docs would be very useful \n    a. Returning sources is great, but given these can be very long, knowing provenance or page number would be big\n3. \"How many employees does Instabase have?\" (see attached response)\n    a. Returning that the answer is not contained within the documents, but still returning some documents decreases trust in the system\n    b. If these are 'closest match' or 'you might also be interested in' docs, they should be labelled as such\n4. Follow-up questions are misleading given that they are unrelated to each other (see attached response)\n    a. This would be powerful in a lot of scenarios - even if it meant taking the source documents and putting them in a Converse pop-out for you to query more specifically\n5. \"What kind of infosec qualifications does the Instabase platform have\" (see attached responses)\n    a. Although not necessarily incorrect - I would have expected info about GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2 to appear in the response here",

      "message": "@Hamish\nThanks for all the feedback.\n1. We will explore feature to cancel a query - there are some technical details to figure out here.\n2. For provenance we have more details about page number in most cases, we can explore . From user experience standpoint, what is kind of experience you are looking at with having page number details for documents? cc: @Varun Jain \n3. Will follow up with team to improve the doc filtering for this query `\"How many employees does Instabase have?\"` \n4. Currently the follow up question will limit to same selected data source as previous questions in search project. There is an EPD initiative in this quarter to enable memory / history for followup search queries, so this  will be more intuitive as that feature is rolled out.\n5. For `What kind of infosec qualifications does the Instabase platform have`  - we currently don't have Trust team docs indexed. Once we add them we should get better answer here.\nDo keep the feedback coming, this is very useful !!",
