      "message": "Hi Team,\nPaychex is facing an issue when using ib_table_extractor_v2 package in the solution we delivered to them.\nThey are able to build the ibflowbin from the ibflow file and able to successfully run the ibflowbin file without any issues.\nBut when they run the ibflow from the flow editor they are getting the following error.\n```Error running Flow: {\"readyState\":4,\"responseText\":\"<html>\\r\\n<head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head>\\r\\n<body>\\r\\n<center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center>\\r\\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n<!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page -->\\r\\n\",\"status\":502,\"statusText\":\"Bad Gateway\"} ```\nThey raised the support ticker here. (https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/3790) logs related to the issue too attached to the ticket.\nInstabase team given the resolution to increase the memory and CPU on their environment, but they could able to fix this issue without needing to increase the resources by pushing the decrypted version of the ib_table_extractor_v2 package.\nib_table_extractor_v2 team mentioned that we have to share only encrypted version of the package, but they are able to get the decrypted version of the code just by extracting the ibsolution file we shared with them.\n\n1. What is the solution for fixing the issue of running the solution on flow editor without the need for having the decrypted version of the package?.\n2. If the solution is encrypted, how they are able to get the decrypted version of the code just by extracting it?\ncc: @Venkatesh @Balaram @Piyush @Veera",

To provide more context, this is the package.json for the package\n\nhttps://instabase.com/apps/text-editor/ib_solutions/solutions/fs/Instabase%20Drive/pre-built/ib_table_extractor_v2/package/package.json\n\nFurthermore, I tried manually extracting from the ibsolution.
