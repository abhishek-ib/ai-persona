We tried a few prompts and couldn’t get it to work. The table goes over a page boundary.\n\nI tried cutting the document up, just to the two pages where the table exists, and it worked perfectly. This seems to be an example where our long document techniques kicked in, and didn’t work too well.\n\n(1st image is long doc, 2nd one is the trimmed doc)",
