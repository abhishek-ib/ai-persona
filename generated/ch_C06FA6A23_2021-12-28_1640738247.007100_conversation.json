      "message": "Hey folks. logging.apache.org (http://logging.apache.org) has updated their mitigation notes for log4j 2.16.0, stating that the workaround we were recommending is insufficient to close all the holes. How does this effect us currently (until we release the new elasticsearch)? Do we think that the mitigation we have recommended is adequate while getting the fixed elasticsearch out to our customers? As this gets out, our customers will continue to ask.\n```Older (discredited) mitigation measures\n\nThis page previously mentioned other mitigation measures, but we discovered that these measures only limit exposure while leaving some attack vectors open.\n\nOther insufficient mitigation measures are: setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true for releases >= 2.10, or modifying the logging configuration to disable message lookups with %m{nolookups}, %msg{nolookups} or %message{nolookups} for releases >= 2.7 and <= 2.14.1.\n\nThe reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use Logger.printf(\"%s\", userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors.\n\nThe safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4j to a safe version, or remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar.```\nSource: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html",
