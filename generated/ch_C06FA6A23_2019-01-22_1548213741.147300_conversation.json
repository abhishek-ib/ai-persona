      "message": "I’ve been doing some major updates on Table Refiner based on all your feedback (thanks all!). Here’s a list of new features (all shown in the demo video):\n1. You can now use *refiner functions and UDFs* (put in `../scripts/`) in Table Refiner. So anything you can run in Refiner, you can run in Table Refiner (thanks @dlluncor!)\n2. You can also view all extracted items in a spreadsheet as in Refiner.\n3. It supports viewing the original PDFs with the scanned text records (@Chetan)\n4. A side item panel for selecting an item/viewing all items (@Matt to fix the “item not in document” bug)\n5. For the upcoming launcher UI @Jessica is releasing soon, I changed Table Refiner’s UI to better support a “fullscreen” mode. I made a top “toolbar” that has common toolbar items like `Files`, `View`, `Help` as desktop apps. It also uses Blueprint for most UI components (instead of bootstrap - @Aaron Vontell @Ted may be interested)\n\nI’m planning to test it with the DHL POC, and should be able to push the code by the end of the week. Feedback welcome!",
