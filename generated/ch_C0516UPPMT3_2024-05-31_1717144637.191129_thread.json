      "message": "Hey, I have just enabled the new Workspaces/Hub view - this is amazing, big improvements here that customers will love :blob-clap: I have a couple of pieces of feedback though:\n1. I find it annoying that the default in Workspaces is 'All workspaces' rather than 'My workspace'. I almost never use other peoples projects (maybe this is just me), so it clutters my view.\n2. To create a new Build project I have to select 'Create App' (which mostly makes sense). To make a new Converse project, I have to select 'Create chatbot' (which doesn't fit with Converse vs Chatbots as I understand them). I find this quite confusing since it appears to say: Build = Create an App, Converse = Create a chatbot. The filter project options are also 'projects' and 'conversations', again different\n    a. I think we just need to be clear with our messaging on the home page (Build/Converse) vs the workspace tab (apps/chatbots)",
