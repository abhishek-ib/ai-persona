Sometimes, these outputs are the results of cleaning and reviewers should be able to access pre-cleaned values to truly review solution performance.\n\nFor example, reviewers might see \"yes\" for a document reasoning field representing whether or not a document is expired, but can't see that the \"yes\" was the result of a cleaning prompt that shortened a longer, more descriptive response.\n\nAnother example:\nReviewers might see a table output, but can't know or see that the table was the result of a cleaning prompt that reformatted a non-table output as a table. Also, should AI Hub (or a solution) have any issues with producing tables, there would be no way to tell as a reviewer what's happening nor why.",

Cleaning will largely rely on LLMs, and we know how that can be sometimes :lil_nervous: So it could be helpful to reviewers to presciently review the original source pre-cleaning.",
