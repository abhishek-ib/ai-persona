I don't recall anything specific coming up with linters during the migration, but I suspect your hypothesis about it being missed in refactored make targets being the likely case @Heymian -- I know we recently enabled goimports in the default vscode config, and I see go-fmt being set as a pre-commit hook here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L62) :thonk: Might be good for us to lift that into a pre-merge check as well for folks who might not be running pre-commit hooks for whatever reason?",
