      "message": "This is super impressive stuff, so naturally I broke out some of the tough challenges I am seeing in market.  One such \"cognition\" challenge seems to struggle across many pages.\n\nI am working on a 9 page doc which has 4 unique \"Container Codes\" and each container has unique \"Materials\" within (materials may or may not be spread across multiple containers).  We do not know how many containers or materials to expect or how they will be arranged.  I am trying to get a JSON of each container and its associated materials.  It seems that I can get at most 2 of them depending on my phrasing.  The detail may be distributed across the doc, however there is often 1 page containing all the details for each container.",
