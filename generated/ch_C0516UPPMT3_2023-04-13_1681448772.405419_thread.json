As @Hari mentioned, these results are definitely in the later half of the document and so they are not getting picked up.   But, in some cases Iâ€™m getting errors around even sending the message.\n\nNote that these are basic research papers that almost all EDU persona will at some point try to use the product for.  So, we should solve this problem.\n\nAttaching the document and the results.",
