We've written a detailed plan for supporting the features during gemini flash app runs and wrote out some options for Build support. Some large open questions that impact the Build design are:\n• Can we split up the gemini run task into classification + extraction? \n• Can we store IBDocs for a build project to support storing doc split info and billing?\nThese qs are covered with more detail in our doc, and if we have time in tmrws meeting we can discuss some. Otherwise we'll set up some other time\ncc @ayesha.ali",
