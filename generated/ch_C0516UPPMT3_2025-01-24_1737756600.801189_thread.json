      "message": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask but do any of our customers use `context['document_text']` param in UDFs? I understand if the document is too large it can cause errors when passing it in as a payload to AWS. Ideally, I'm thinking of migrating the way users can access it (i.e. `context['document_text']` --> `get_document_text()` where the function will be defined above the UDF and will read it in the from the file system) but this may break any current usages and we may need to include documentation to read the file.\n\n@pauline.comising @Anil @jack.robbins @hannah @andy @Jessica",
