      "message": "I can’t say with certainty (haven’t looked at the code yet, been afk heh) but I suspect the meaningful delta is that sandbox builds use the new buildkit farm infrastructure, and certify still has to use the old clunky caching infra (first iteration that uses local buildkit and s3 cache) \nIt might be that the centralized buildkit farm is saving us from some very slow operations, or could be that the certify nodes are just not up to the job anymore. \n\nI’ll see what I can find Monday afternoon and hopefully get something I can share.",
