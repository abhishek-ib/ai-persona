      "message": "Hi all, we are excited to announce the following GA and preview features in 24.18 for AI Hub IDP. Here you can find the release notes (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/aihub-preview/releasenotes/index.html) (including updated pricing policy) and the latest feature flag and release process (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqGypOIBZymAmvHTXhlC8FOCX9lXD6cApQbQP2qanDQ/edit).\n\n*GA:* These features are now generally available for all internal and external users.\n• *Getting Started:* Enhanced getting started experience by enabling copying an existing project schema or importing prebuilt classes\n• *Field Description:* In extraction prompts, the previously unnamed prompt field is now labeled Description and both field name and description are now sent to the model, where previously only the prompt was sent. \n• *App Versioning:* You can now version apps and specify more robust app metadata. \n• *Advanced Model in Build:* Commercial users can now opt to use an advanced model for individual fields. \n• *Classification Pricing:* AI Hub now charges for classification and split classification in Build and Build app runs. For commercial subscriptions, this change applies at the start of the next billing cycle to begin on or after May 13th, 2024.\n*Internal Preview (default on):* These features are enabled by default as they are expected to GA soon. You can go to settings to switch the feature on or off.\n• *New field creation:*  General UX improvements including being taken to the Field Editor directly when creating a new field.\n• *Advanced OCR settings:* Modify digitization settings to recognize non-latin characters and treat all documents as images to force OCR.\n• *Confidence score for reasoning prompts:* Reasoning prompts now have a confidence score associated with the response. These scores can be leveraged for validations. \n• *Deploy*: Create deployments to configure upstream integrations, downstream integrations and human review settings. All deployments can be monitored in a consolidated deployment dashboard.\n• *Workspace revamp:* My Hub has been renamed to Workspaces and contains projects, conversations, deployments and datasources. Within workspaces, an All Workspace tab now aggregates activities across all workspaces you can access. \n• *Prompt-based validation:* Create validations to test fields via prompts. These prompts will generate validation code that can be further reviewed.\n• *Classification confidence validation:* Classification now includes a model confidence score, which can be leveraged to create a validation rule on the class.\n*Internal Preview (default off):* These features are still in development and are default off. You can try out these features to give feedback, but they are not intended to be used in demos or in customer engagements.\n• *Classify single doc:* users can now iterate on class name and description for a single doc first, enabling a quicker reclassification experience.\n• *Class description:* users can now enter descriptions of classes to improve classification accuracy.",
