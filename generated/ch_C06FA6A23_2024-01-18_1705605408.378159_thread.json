      "message": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs the first step of our effort to separate the marketing and platform websites for dogfood.instabase.com (http://dogfood.instabase.com) and instabase.com (http://instabase.com), we are going to separate the platform URLs into platform.dogfood.instabase.com (http://platform.dogfood.instabase.com) and platform.instabase.com (http://platform.instabase.com), respectively. Both platform.* URLs are working today, so please start using them instead of dogfood.instabase.com (http://dogfood.instabase.com) and instabase.com (http://instabase.com).\n\nOver this upcoming weekend, we will be merging an nginx change that will separate the platform to only be served on platform.dogfood.instabase.com (http://platform.dogfood.instabase.com) and marketing site to only be served on dogfood.instabase.com (http://dogfood.instabase.com). Once this change is made, only platform.dogfood.instabase.com (http://platform.dogfood.instabase.com) can be used for platform dogfood related operations. We are updating release/test pipelines, patches, and patch professor to use the new URL, but please let us know if there are any other upstream applications or solutions that need to be updated with the new URL.\n\nWe are aiming to roll out this separation for platform.instabase.com (http://platform.instabase.com) and instabase.com (http://instabase.com) (marketing only) when we GA the 24.01 release - currently estimated for January 29th.\n\nTL;DR use platform.dogfood.instabase.com (http://platform.dogfood.instabase.com) today, which will replace dogfood.instabase.com (http://dogfood.instabase.com) starting this Monday. Use platform.instabase.com (http://platform.instabase.com) today, which will replace instabase.com (http://instabase.com) on January 29th",
