But we might want to have smoother feedback mechanism to the chatbot users - at the moment:\n• It’s takes a long time to load and fail.\n• there’s a number of warning messages.\n• `Back to AI Hub` - it’s possible that a chatbot creator will want to customise that button to kick the user back to where they were before they opened chatbot.
