I've repurposed our previous github copilot channel into <#C06JUUJFKDY|> as a forum for these topics and discussions. If you are using any tooling today that you would recommend to other engineers, please throw up a post about them in that channel soon! Looking forward to more discussion there :smile::thank_you:",
