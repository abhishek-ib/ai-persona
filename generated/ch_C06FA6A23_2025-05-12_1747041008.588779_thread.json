      "message": "Hi team\nIf were to validate effect of underlying infra changes (for ex: node autoscaling in/out) on the SaaS Platform/AIHub, what's the best way to observe?\nSpecifically looking for proactive information and not from customer generated traffic like typical RED metrics. Do we have platform status readings available in grafana? How often and what all they measure?\nThe reason for not looking for customer generated traffic is I would like to be able to test the disruptions even in a Standalone sandbox kind of environment.",
