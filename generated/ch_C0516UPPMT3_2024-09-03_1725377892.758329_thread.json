      "message": "Hello everyone, I am working on improving the performance of the extraction model in form like documents and I am strangling a bit with creating proper annotations. I am using the model studio to do so which has some shortcomings since it is not aligned with how llm responds.\nEven if we don’t consider this problem I still don’t know how is the proper way to create the fields (e.g. what our customers will do) and I am asking for feedback from anyone that have worked in such usecases (especially with checkboxes)\nAttached you can see two examples of my annotations and my questions are:\n1. is it logical from our customers for such documents to add the Box X as part of the field name? Or at least as part of the description?\n2. If it is a checkbox, how are they going to phrase the field name (or description). Are they going to ask a question (e.g. is it limited partner of an LLC) or they are going to ask (limited partner of an LLC checked? ) (CHECK image 2) \n3. What we do in the usecase that are two checkboxes with Yes/No. are the customers going to ask (Did the partner contributed …) and expect a yes or no or have two questions (Did the partner contributed … -> Yes ) and (Did the partner contributed … -> No)  ? \nAre there any other tricky situations that you have seen with checkboxes?",
