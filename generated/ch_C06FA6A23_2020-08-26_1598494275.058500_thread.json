This might be the cause of the current failing golden test. How to reproduce:\n1. Open a metaflow binary\n2. Select an input folder that has multiple files \n3. Change the batch size to a number smaller than the # of input files \n4. Run flow, flow never finishes. Check the output folder, the number of files processed == batch size\ncc @shaunak @abhilash",
