      "message": "Hey, a candidate yesterday noted that the class options of using pre-built classes for Build projects disappear if you already have a class by that name. We couldn't figure out why they weren't appearing until after the interview.\n\nI think it makes sense to grey the options out + tooltip instead. E.g. if I have a bank statement class, I might still want to use the pre-built one as the basis for another similar class e.g. a different country, language, supplier etc. It just has to be clear that I need to change the class name instead of the option hiding itself",
