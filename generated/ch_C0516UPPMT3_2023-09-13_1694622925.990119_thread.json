      "message": "Just a follow-up on the language capabilities - for Japanese documents, it seems to have difficulties differentiating the different character types native to Japanese (i.e. it seems to take the Kanji or the chinese characters pretty well, but then gets confused with the Katakana characters - typically used for foreign words).\n\nIn this example, 'Kon Ku Ri To' means \"Concrete\" (a foreign word in katakana). So in answering what type of roof does this building have, it correctly infers it is steel (written in kanji). But despite correctly taking the phonetics 'kon ku ri to', it is unable to translate. A regular consumer Google translate by picture is able to do it, so it may simply be a setting or missing language module that prevents it from translating correctly.\n\nScreenshot and document attached.",
