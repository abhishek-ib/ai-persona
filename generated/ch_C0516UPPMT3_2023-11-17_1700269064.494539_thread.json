This new pipeline:\n• Reduces verbose responses\n• Provides confidence scores on ~any length of~ documents less than 20 pages :tada:\n*Caveat: we have not yet integrated this pipeline into compiled apps*, so the compiled app will still run the old pipeline (and will potentially show different results than what you see in the Build app).\n\nWe are very excited for you to try this out! Please post any feedback in <#C0516UPPMT3|>\ncc @joshbronko @Matt Weaver @Lee please try this out! :pray:  We'd love to see how it does on the wide variety of docs you see.",
