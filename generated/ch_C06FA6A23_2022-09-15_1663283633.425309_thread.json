      "message": "Hi team, do we have a guide for adding a python dependency? I'm adding `openpyxl`. I was able to add the library itself, but mypy tests don't pass because I haven't added typing stubs. There is also an implemented `openpyxl-stubs` library for typing, but that library requires an incompatible version of `typing-extensions` (>=3.10) with some of our other python dependencies so I can't compile requirements.in (http://requirements.in) if I add `openpyxl-stubs` there. Any way I can move forward here?",
