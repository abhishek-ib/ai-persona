The main change is the addition of expectations for Eng Managers at different levels. We also outline the expectations for each level and outline the two career tracks (SWE and EM).\n\nPlease take a look here (https://instabase.workplace.com/groups/528429595250790/permalink/535528957874187/) and be open with your questions and feedback. We can discuss on the comments on the post or in 1:1s. Thanks!",
