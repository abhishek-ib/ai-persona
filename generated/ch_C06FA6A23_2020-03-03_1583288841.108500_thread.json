Do we have a response that works for this or any UDFs that we are comfortable sharing?\n```Can you please provide us sample UDFs for the use cases below:\n\n1.       UDF to read xml or json file from Instabase Drive.\n\n2.       UDF to read output of Refiner/Table Refiner.\n\n3.       UDF for writing data to a file on Instabase Drive.```",

This is an important starting point for UDFs in Flow: https://www.instabase.com/docs/reference/apps/flow/udfs-in-flow/\n\nIn the IBFile section it shows how to read / write files in a sample UDF. That would cover (1) and (3)\n\nFor (2), they should use the ParsedIBOCR interface. @shaunak should have a description and documentation for the ParsedIBOCR interface (the way you can read data from the IBOCR that a Refiner row generates)",
