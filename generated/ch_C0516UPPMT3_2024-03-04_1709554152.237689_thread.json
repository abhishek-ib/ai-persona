This is OCR / digitization feedback.\n\nIn the example in the ticket, the checkbox renders correctly on our macs, but doesn’t when on AI Hub, which means the extraction then fails. I’ll log other OCR issues under this initiative.\n\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1586",

      "message": "Thanks Kerry, happy to take any feedback on how these should be logged. Before it was discussed that Intitatives could have muliple of the same examples logged in one ticket. So we’ve have one for all issues with checkboxes, one for all with OCR etc. We could then attach bugs or FRs to this as needed.\n\nI’m keen to capture lots of examples of documents and usecases that we can benchmark performance on to improve feature depth, and also to include in our regression tests. But open to the best way to do this.",
