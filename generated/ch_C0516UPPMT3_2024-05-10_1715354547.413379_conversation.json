      "message": "Hello~ I have some feedback on chatbot UI/UX (based on observations in UAT)\n• I think the *Open file panel* button should be on the left, because the file panel itself opens on the left. Having the button on the right makes it kind of a weird surprise that the panel then expands from the opposite side of the screen. \n• I think the file panel should default to open if our prompt window says “Query your files” and has “All files” listed. Defaulting to closed makes it confusing as to what files we’re talking about. I think especially if you’re a new user to AI Hub chatbots--most chatbots I’ve encountered don’t make a link to the source files/let you see the source files, so I wouldn’t necessarily assume I can see them somewhere.\n    ◦ This would also make it more intuitive to understand what the *Open file panel* button is for—without the context of knowing a file panel exists, it looks like it could be for uploading documents maybe. It’s not clear that it expands anything (especially given its location on the page).\n• When I scale down my window’s width with the file panel open, all the width is being sacrificed from the chat panel. I’d rather we scale the document list or other sections of the panel file--seeing my chat panel is more valuable than a list of files. \n    ◦ Overall, incorporating a more intuitive and granular system of expanding and closing panels would be helpful, maybe just a simple *>* or *<* arrow button in the edge of each panel.\n• _Minor nit feedback_: We have some inconsistent capitalization--some labels are in title case, others in sentence case. Everything should be in sentence case.",
