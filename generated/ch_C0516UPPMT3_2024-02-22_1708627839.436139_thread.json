      "message": "Hi. For existing enterprise customers, do we have any materials with guidance of when to use their platform with Deep Learning et al or when to consider using AI Hub for a new use case? This is notably for end-to-end processing use cases (build).\n> Speaking to the Chase Document Understanding CoE, they are looking to define a decision tree and want to ensure fit for purpose considerations of whether to use their existing platform or note use cases as considerations for AI Hub (LLMs).\nAlso, do we also have a Capabilities Deck for AI Hub to share as well? Or is aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com) still the best place for this information?",

Can this wait until Atlanta to be answered in detail? :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nRe capabilities, will let @Clemens share latest capabilities deck, and also please note we will be rolling out a revamped roadmap in ATL as well.\n\nFor Chase specifically, since they don't have access to AI Hub yet, is this exercise being conducted to justify AI Hub? Or are they assuming they will have access in the near term?",

They are hearing about AI Hub from others in Chase, aware it's not in their current agreement and want to know the differences / benefits compared to the current platform (to build out a use case decision tree).",
