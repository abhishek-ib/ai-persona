A list and brief description of all our services can be found here (https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/reference/services/overview/). There’s also a comprehensive list of every environment variable across all services here (https://dogfood.instabase.com/docs/reference/services/env-docs-svc/). (there are ~500 of them so not made for light reading). The list is scrapped from our generated deployment jinja’s, and pre-merge checks will help guarantee that these stay up-to-date.",
