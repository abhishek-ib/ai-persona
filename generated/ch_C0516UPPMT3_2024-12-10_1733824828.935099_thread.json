      "message": "Hi team, just had a call with a prospect for Search/Chatbot use cases and wanted to share some feedback:\n1. Main use case is increasing Sales/BD productivity by improving access to right content/information, but they're looking to onboard a horizontal tool that can also support use cases for HR/Finance and other teams in the future\n2. Demo'd internal search preview and also a chatbot on their docs that they sent over\n3. They're exploring internal build using Claude (very early stages) and other similar solutions (e.g. Glean)\n4. Overall, I think the capabilities resonated with the team - asked lots of questions about accuracy & relevance of the results and the \"so what\" of it all\n    a. There was definitely interest in what can be done with the responses - e.g. can they create a Jira ticket from a chatbot response. We mentioned emails as a proof that we're implementing AI agents, but competitors like Glean already have app integrations like that. They also asked about generation based on results (e.g. create a call plan based on the response), which we can do a better job with.\n    b. One capability that seemed to resonate with them was unstructured content understanding - I showed how to search for a specific map (e.g. Where can I find the maps with different fruits? SS attached) and they were impressed with the visual reasoning element to return relevant results. Also showed how to look for specific tables and hammered the point about how much unstructured data is present in their corpus of documents\n5. As a follow up, do we have a full list of connectors that we're aiming to have at launch? They mentioned Sharepoint, Confluence, Onedrive, Jira, github, hubspot, SFDC, etc. They also asked about customizability for source systems (e.g. internal services they have built out)\ncc @Sanch @margaret.tomaszczuk",
