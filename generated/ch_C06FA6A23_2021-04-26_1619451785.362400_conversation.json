Open up your chrome dev tools in the environment it's not working\n2. Go to the Application tab\n3. Expand \"Cookies\" in the lefthand menu and click the url below\n4. There should be three cookies where the name is \"session,\" with three different domains - dogfood, uat.dogfood, and instabase.com (http://instabase.com). Delete all three of these cookies\n5. You'll have to log back into all of your environments\nThis worked for me, please let me know if (or if not) it works for you!",
