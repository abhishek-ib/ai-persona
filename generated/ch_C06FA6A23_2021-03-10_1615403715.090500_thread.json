This newer version of dynamic proxy appears to misbehave after running for a few hours. We are still unclear why dynamic proxy behavior becomes unpredictable. In order to resolve the problem, we reverted to the old version of dynamic proxy and all notebook operations appear to be normal now. We will continue to monitor the notebook stack.",
