      "message": "Wanted to share difficulties I’ve had using solution builder as a non-technical user. When things aren’t working, I just assume the tool doesn’t work. In reality, the solution does work if you use the complex prompt option and add the proper context (thanks @Dan H).\n\nCommenting with screenshots of my attempt to extract shipping address from the invoice:\n• *Attempt 1*: this was from the suggested fields, completely incorrect, just a list of numbers \n• *Attempt 2*: Tried to create a new field for shipping address, AI Hub got some of it right, but included payment information in between street address and zip code. I got stuck on this part, I was looking for a way to correct the output and it didn’t seem like that was possible. \n• *Attempt 3*: complex prompt asking to extract the shipping address but not include payment information or vendor address. It would not have occurred to me to provide this level of specificity without the nudge from Dan",

I would assume something like this which represents the core/basic functionality should be solvable without reverting to the docs.\n\nIf the goal is that average people can use the product, we need to be realistic.  Average users will not think about documentation.  Particularly for base functionality.  Documentation should supplement for a-typical or complex use cases.  If you need to research how to do the core product, users will give up.",
