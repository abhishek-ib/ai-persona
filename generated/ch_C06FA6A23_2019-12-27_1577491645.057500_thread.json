I just merged a change that should cut that time down drastically (for me it went down from > 16s to like 2s). But I had to change up the way some things were stored in Redis. So if anyone sees weird repo/acl-related errors when working locally, please make sure to delete your redis cache:\n```cd <folder you run redis from>\nrm dump.rdb```",
