I will love to hear your thoughts on where we have left gaps in the security model described in the following document. The only two exceptions in this model are (1) client-side encryption for File System and Databases, (2) key management for encryption at rest for FS and DB. We are planning to incorporate these two in the near future. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC6f09bHlSr1HrRCuglaLwvbIGdudykkZVVdJKoIl5A/edit#",
