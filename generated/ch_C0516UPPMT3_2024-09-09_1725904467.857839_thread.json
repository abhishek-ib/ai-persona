      "message": "Hey team, we have a Commercial customer building a Passport solution on AI Hub for a POC. They are running into performance issues around MRZ codes that I haven't been able to resolve for them.\n• Using the pre-built classes and Passport App, the MRZ code field has mistakes in the results even for the sample files (sometimes). This is the customer's sample run link (https://aihub.instabase.com/review/549031b5-4f80-4941-98ab-92b6641c3afe) with incorrect extractions.\n• I tried to improve the prompt, but the underlying issue seems to be the OCR and layout processing (see 3 examples below). Almost every passport seems to get put in this format which really limits what we can do with prompting to get the info out. \n• As far as I can tell, the only solution here would be include stricter validations. This means significantly lowering the automation rate which means we lose out to their current incumbent solution. \nDo we have any solutions for Passports we could use here based on previous work? Is there anything else we could use to improve performance here? I'm aware that there is a set structure to MRZ codes that I'd provide to the customer to use as a validation if nothing else.\n\ncc @david.lee @Nico @Piyush @Pramod Munemanik @Nithin",

Most of the problem I'm observing is in the trailing filler characters. The scanned document to OCR extracted values seem to be accurate, but OCR to document reasoning output is where the trailing characters either get cut (e.g. 23 trailing chars in OCR results to 21 in field value), or extra ones get added.",
