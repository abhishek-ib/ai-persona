      "message": ":cypress-spin: Cypress on-call summary for the week of Apr 28\nLast week, Cypress CI was mostly stable. It helped catch several backend bugs:\n1. `nested-field-editor.spec.ts` failed due to a backend bug. The test was marked as non-blocking while @prateek.tenkale worked on the fix (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1745964871036539)). Thank you @prateek.tenkale \n2. `advanced-apps.spec.ts, documents-grid.spec.ts, create-delete-app.spec.ts, ground-truth-crud.spec.ts` failed due to a backend bug. @ayesha.ali fixed it. (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1746038747042109)). Thank you @ayesha.ali\n3. On Thursday, Crafting sandboxes failed to stand up because the script we used to set up the sandbox stopped working. I updated the script based on Crafting support team's suggestion. The Cypress CI was marked as non-blocking at 4 PM on Thursday and was restored to blocking at 11 AM on Friday (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1746138448792319))\nSeparately, I fixed some flaky Cypress tests (PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/70214)): `workspace-settings.spec.ts, workspaces-manage-members.spec.ts,, ground-truth-crud.spec.ts` .\nFinally, I merged in the PR that makes Cypress CI only re-run the failed blocking tests if git SHA is unchanged. Check out the thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1746220514008359) above for more details.\n\nSome stats: The median failure rate for blocking tests last week was around 6% (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/analytics/top-failures?branches=%5B%5D&browsers=%5B%5D&chartRangeMostCommonErrors=%5B%5D&chartRangeSlowestTests=%5B%5D&chartRangeTopFailures=%5B%5D&committers=%5B%5D&cypressVersions=%5B%5D&flaky=%5B%5D&operatingSystems=%5B%5D&runGroups=%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%221%20-%20blocking%22%2C%22suggested%22%3Afalse%2C%22value%22%3A%221%20-%20blocking%22%7D%2C%7B%22label%22%3A%221%20non-blocking%22%2C%22suggested%22%3Afalse%2C%22value%22%3A%221%20non-blocking%22%7D%5D&specFiles=%5B%5D&status=%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22Passed%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22PASSED%22%7D%2C%7B%22label%22%3A%22Failed%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22FAILED%22%7D%5D&tags=%5B%7B%22disabled%22%3Afalse%2C%22label%22%3A%22ci%22%2C%22labelProperties%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23dadade%22%7D%2C%22suggested%22%3Afalse%2C%22value%22%3A%22ci%22%7D%5D&tagsMatch=ANY&timeInterval=WEEK&timeRange=%7B%22startDate%22%3A%222025-04-28%22%2C%22endDate%22%3A%222025-05-02%22%2C%22id%22%3Anull%7D&viewBy=TEST_CASE).\nTop failures are (excluding 2 login-related dummy tests I added for testing and were never run on others' PRs)\n• `nested-field-editor.spec.ts` \n• `ground-truth-crud.spec.ts`\n• `aihub-refinement.spec.ts`\n•  `aihub-split-by-page.spec.ts`\n• `edit-existing-app.spec.ts`",
