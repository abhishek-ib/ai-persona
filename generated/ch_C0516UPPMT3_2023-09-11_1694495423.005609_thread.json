This request is to unblock a PoC with an enterprise customer, and hence higher sensitivity to set expectations on timelines.\n\n@hannah @Heymian - lets have a quick sync this week on the requirements and if / how we can accommodate them in Q3. I’ll find time for us.",

Xi did attempt an early PoC of this back when we started, and quickly realized it was not going to be super straight forward to fit into our existing file-service requirements (one example: you cannot implement Stat() on these files to get a file size).\n\nI’ll sync with Hannah on this to see what other work we’ll need to deprioritize if we need to get this in for 23.10/23.41 given we are already running very close to the deadline. If this can wait for 23.43 or 23.45, I would be much more conformable with that.",
