      "message": "One additional point unrelated to the document above but more towards the experience: using LLMs is like working with the smartest kid in the classroom - it gets so much right straight away out of the box. Which is amazing. But even the smartest kids make mistakes with stuff they have never seen before. I have no way to correct this kid and tell it that it is looking at the wrong thing and should be looking at this field rather than the one it is extracting. I think that is fine for Converse where you’re more exploring, but when building an app, you really want to be able to say “no, it is this field I want. This is the right answer”, especially after having prompted it in 16 different ways :)",
