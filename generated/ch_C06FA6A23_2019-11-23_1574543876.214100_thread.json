      "message": "<!subteam^SQ3KR3V17|@Software Engineers> we all need to perform an unplanned UAT on Monday. We discovered security vulnerabilities in Apache Thrift last weekend. @will and @Heymian have put in a monumental effort this week to upgrade all the services. They also have performed basic checkouts. However, we need a UAT to be production-grade ready.\n.\nIn terms of criticality of this patch, customers such as JPMC, GS India, and BAML are waiting on us for these updates. They need these software updates as soon as we can sign off on UAT.\n.\nI will push all the updates to alt-dogfood and prepare instructions for the UAT.\n.\nPlease let me know if anyone feels that this UAT is unwarranted.",

      "message": "Please let's do a UAT that tests most of the features (if not all). Healthy paranoia is essential in this scenario. Finding an issue later on and having to send a patch to a customer like JPMC is extremely expensive especially considering we have a nascent relationship with them. They really are not the easiest bunch to work with since they fear each deployment can crop up a new security vulnerability in their internal security scans which leads to painful discussions with their security team.",
