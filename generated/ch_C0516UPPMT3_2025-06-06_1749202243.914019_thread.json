      "message": "would be good to get product's insight here as I'm facing this with a few customer conversations where we are selling to a parent company with many subsidiaries operating across georgraphies e.g. Kering, Lufthansa (300 subsidiaries), Bertelsmann. In these cases the centralised team aren't the only ones building - their goal is to provide licenses to the business units to build their own solutions. What's the recommended approach for how to operationalise this citizen development type programme in an easy to manage way?",
