      "message": "Hi all,\nI did some vibe coding this past Instabreak and was able to build a tool to automatically address vulnerability tickets assigned to me. The tool queries Jira for VTEST tickets assigned to me, checks out the respective branch on my local checkout, does package upgrades and creates draft PRs for them. I got 3 PRs created using this tool - go (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/70914), python on master (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/70918) and python on 24.07 (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/70916).\nI am going to check this in to the experimental repo soon. If you want to hack on it and add support for resolving package conflicts or make it truly agentic using MCP, let me know.",
