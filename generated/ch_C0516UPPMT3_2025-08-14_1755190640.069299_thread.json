      "message": "Few thoughts:\n• The customer’s point about `list files` being removed is confusing. Assuming they really are talking about AI Hub and not Platform, are they talking about list files in a batch (which has existed since February 2025) or list files in a directory (which has never existed that I can find in the Git history of `openapi.yaml`, but has an open ticket EPD-4668 to add)?\n• The GitHub repo that holds the `openapi.yaml` spec file for the AI Hub API is not private, so anyone can get the latest API spec at `https://github.com/instabase/aihub-openapi/blob/master/openapi.yaml`\n• I haven’t seen any operations removed from the AI Hub API/SDK since I started documenting it in the middle of 2024. I’ve only seen operations added, and I think one parameter name changed.\n• We’ve never deprecated any endpoints for AI Hub that I’m aware of (unless that happened before mid-2024).\n• The AI Hub API/SDK reference documentation (not the hand-written API/SDK tutorial pages) is autogenerated from the `openapi.yaml` spec so always reflects the API/SDK as of the current release.\n• Lucile’s bullet points about our versioning and deprecation philosophies and version support commitments are @Anil questions, I think.",
