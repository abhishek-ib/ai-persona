A key requirement for them to use this at scale is to call the chatbot via API, provide a list of questions to ask the RFP that correspond to the customer-specific RFP request, and then the ability to integrate the responses in an internal system or export as an excel spreadsheet (cc: @avi@Varun Jain). Exciting to see our enterprise customers explore use cases outside of IDP!",
