This would be the issue that customer developers would face as well and would be a major issue for getting a production solution.\n\nOn our Trust Deeds class, the project provides good results with our prompts. At run-time, the app provides poor results. We can't improve results because there is no easy way to do live iteration, and the build project already provides good results. This has been particularly problematic for calculating accuracy metrics since 'Accuracy Tests' becomes redundant. Instead we are manually calculating accuracy using the project view (as this gives us the best results). App runs give consistent, but poor results.\n\nApp run: https://nab.internal.instabase.com/review/d9c25216-4841-401f-95a4-21b39f21c274\nProject: https://nab.internal.instabase.com/build/01971111-93b4-7f85-b1cb-f5b0a31ba405\n\ncc @Kaustubh (KD) @Sankeerthana @Shridhar Kawalkar",
