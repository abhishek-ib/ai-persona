      "message": "Hey team, working on an interesting use case that's prompted some product questions from me. Docs provided: one handwritten completed form and one empty copy of the same form. Experimental Build project here (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/build/e67c25d1-2265-4a25-bbb3-f1f8de8ee158).\n1. The OCR doesn't perform well (tested Microsoft + Google). Are there plans to include OCR confidence in AI Hub? Could we utilise a combination of OCR confidence + LLM to improve the OCR output? E.g. Owner Name = Mr & Mrs Smith, is picked up incorrectly but is obvious to a human from the context. \n2. Reasoning prompts don't seem to do well with fuzzy matching of checkbox names. Example: OCR picks up 'Photo Tribute Box' as 'Toto Tribute Box', but with reasoning prompts I have struggled to get the LLM to realise they are the same thing (e.g. I tried passing a list of exclusive possible options)\n3. The \"table of checkboxes\" doesn't seem to be handled very well. I imagine scenarios when it would be useful to make a validation function along the lines of 'only one checkbox allowed per column', that wouldn't be possible currently. \n4. Given we have been provided with an empty copy of the original form, can we utilise this to improve performance? I'm thinking reading the template content so if handwriting covers it in future submissions there is no missing information, or using more expensive models or utilising longer processing time as a once off, or auto-population of some fields? \n@Lee @cooper.addis",
