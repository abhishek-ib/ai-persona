AFAIK, crafting-cyp is used for running pre-merge cypress tests but I am not sure what crafting-aihub is used for.\nContext: Deployments to this sandbox have been consistently failing for several days and I want to understand the impact of these failures before suggesting we kill it :slightly_smiling_face:",
