Although, multistep _does_ remember your questions, correct? So maybe “Not all Converse models remember your previous questions. Give context in each question.”\n4. change to “Try the advanced or multistep models for large documents or complex queries.” (add article, add multistep).\nHappy to make this into a ticket, if you like?",
