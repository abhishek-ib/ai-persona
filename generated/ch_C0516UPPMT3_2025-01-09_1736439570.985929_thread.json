      "message": "Hey, a couple of observations on selection based prompt generation:\n1. There is a bug for split classified docs, where the selected text on page 2 actually picks out text that is contained on the same page coordinates on page 1 (different class). See the attached video\n2. In general, I'm seeing poor matches between the suggested prompts and the extracted results. Not sure if this is only because I'm using it for fields where I'm already struggling or because we have updated prompt wrappers/pipelines since this feature was made\ncc @Vishnu",
