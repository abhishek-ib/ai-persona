      "message": "RE: Human Review functionality:\n\nWhen actively reviewing documents in the review modal, we have two \"terminal\" review actions available:\n1. Mark as reviewed\n2. Save and submit\nFirst point of feedback:\n1. I feel like `1.` and `2.` above are essentially the same? \n    a. `2. Save and submit` should be a button that only allows you to `submit` and requires you to `mark as reviewed` in order to submit.\n        i. Ie. `Save and submit` -> `Submit` (contingent on marking as reviewed)\n2. Connecting with `1.` immediately above, I feel like adding a third action, `skip` or `next` (and even `previous`, for that matter) would be good to have.\n3. It may be nice to be able to add quick tags or notes to a document during review: \n    a. Should additional context be helpful when escalating or skipping a document, the escalating/skipping reviewer can provide such context and it would be made available to the next reviewer.\nBack in the day, I've spent some time as an annotator/reviewer, and I've often found myself (and others, too) skipping/hitting `next` on items to address them later without escalating. We were also able to add notes for additional context, which was helpful at all levels of the review cycle and even helpful for improving solutions to be less confusing/more effective.\n\nHappy to provide more detail as needed :sparkles:",
