      "message": "Came back to look at this and saw that you’ve already gotten these changes in--thank you! I did notice two more unexpected behaviors/bugs while using this on sandbox:\n\n• Using the sort order icons in the *Date* column fails to reorder the rows of the Deep dive table. I.e. even as I cycle through the arrow icons, the rows stay in the same order. The other columns work as expected.\n    ◦ If I’ve changed the sort order using a _different_ column, such as Units or Mode clicking the sort icon under Date does then reset the rows by date, but I can’t actually change the sort order beyond that.\n• When I select a date range, I don’t think the end date is being included. E.g. if I select July 2-3, I only see results for July 2nd, or if I select July 2-8 I see results for July 2-7. \ncc @Weiming Wu @Josh Rad",
