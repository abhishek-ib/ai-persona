      "message": "Team, this happens frequently on all environments but today it has happened at least 10 or 12 times and it’s kind of frustrating. While I’m working in refiner, at some point, all windows for that environment will just crash.\n\nSo if I have the filesystem up, a script window for editing a functions py file, and other items - they will all come to this screen. What this means is that if I’m not saving frequently in refiner, my changes will be lost but it also means that I have to re-load all the windows that crashed as well as re-run all fields in that refiner. I typically lose at least ten minutes every time this happens and I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one this happens to.\n\nDo we know why this happens?\n\nNote: in this screenshot, only the rbc sandbox windows are going down but the demo-2 windows are still up and running. As far as I can tell, this only seems to happen when I am actively working in refiner and it will kill all tabs for that environment (in this case rbc but I have seen it in all environments)",
