      "message": "Additionally, is there a way to add website URLS to Converse projects (and Chatbots)? Currently I have downloaded the website content as a PDF and then uploaded it, but it would be great if this could be streamlined by somehow inserting the relevant URL (and maybe seeing a document preview, even if this is just this download and upload process in the background).\n\nI think customisability for if and when website updates are pulled would be really useful here. E.g. if a website is updated with new sports fixtures, I want these updates to be automatically pulled into the project. However, if the website was more like a static knowledge base (e.g. a Wikipedia page I have vetted), I might not want any new changes to automatically be pulled in",

Websites behind auth are on our mind, but we don't have active discussions for them yet. It can become quite complex to support them and for a lot of them, a more native data source ingestion might make more sense than web scraping (eg: confluence, slack, google drive, etc.)",
