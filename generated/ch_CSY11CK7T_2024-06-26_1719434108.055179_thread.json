      "message": "@Subash and co, I have my first question about where something should live. Say I want to add a component for a user's initials (like in a circle the way we have a lot of places). At first glance this seems like it should go in `shared`. However, it also depends on the type `TMember` , which right now lives in a subdirectory of `Components`. In this case, would I:\n1. Start moving types like `TMember` to `shared`, despite the fact that they come from the data layer, and put the initials component in `shared`\n2. Put them somewhere in `store` and `entities`??",
