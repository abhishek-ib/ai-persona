      "message": "I've been trying out excels in AI Hub Build, and have some feedback:\n1. It seems like Form Recogniser is unable to pick up any of the tables in my excel, so I've found that a reasoning prompt is returning better results than a table extraction (Document Attached). There is no visible table structure in the excel, so this may be caused as we create a PDF, then form recognise that PDF, but either way we cannot rely on excels having neat visual tables.\n2. Sometimes the column headers are output (incorrectly) into the body of the table - this can be sorted with cleaning, but would be better if it was sorted without that.  (Shown in the first image)\n3. The table that's been created from the excel is in a different order from the tabs in the input document. You can see in the screenshot attached that the vessels from the first tab of this excel are output at the end of the table",
