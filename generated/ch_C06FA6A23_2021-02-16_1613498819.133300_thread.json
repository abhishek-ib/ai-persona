      "message": "*OCR Update:*\n\nHi Team,\n\nI am excited to announce that we now have support for *Microsoft Read 3.2* in *Dogfood*. Read 3.2 is nice upgrade over the Read 2.0 version we are currently using, and will offer a number of new features and improvements:\n• *Improved OCR Quality*: Read 3.2 uses a completely new underlying model, which should provide more accurate results and be able to read documents that previously were too low quality to OCR.\n• *Numeric Confidence Scores*: Unlike Read 2.0 which just tells us if a word is “low_confidence”, 3.2 provides a word confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each word on the page. This new field is now accessible in the IBDoc.\n• *More Language Support*: Read 2.0 only supports English, but is able to do fairly well with any language that uses the Latin alphabet. Read 3.2 has support for 73 different languages (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/language-support#optical-character-recognition-ocr), including symbolic and character based languages.\n*How do you use Read 3.2 on Instabase?*\nRight now, the setting to enable this in hidden in the OcrCfg of Process Files, by adding this setting:\n``` \"model_specific_settings\": {\n  \"marx_v1\": {\n   \"version\": \"v3\"\n  }\n }```\nThis setting is not final. If and when we start using this more and deploying to customers, we will make it more discoverable, likely as an additional OCR Model.\n\n*Can we use this for Customers?*\n*No.* Read 3.2 on Instabase is currently available for *internal testing only*. After some initial load tests, it seems that the 3.2 containers use *4x the CPU and ~2x the Memory to get comparable latency performance to Read 2.0 containers*. We are working with the Microsoft team to try to decrease these resource requirements, but for now we look at this as a *hard blocker for deploying this to any of our customers*. Dogfood is currently using the Azure Cloud Read 3.2 API instead of the Read 3.2 container, so performance on Dogfood will not be representative of what it would be in a real environment.\n\nLet me know if there are any questions or any bugs. Would love to get some feedback on this!",
