      "message": "@Weiming Wu I think there are some issues with concurrent tests for view-my-hub - we create 4 projects where the names are the same each time, so if two are running at the same time and we check that there are 4 elements found by search, there could be 8 instead, like in this run (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/10329/overview?roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1). What if we prefixed them all with a uuid instead of \"My Hub\" and searched for that instead?",

And then there's a `deleteProjectIfItExists` util that you can use to delete projects with the `My Hub` prefix that are older than X (we usually do 20) minutes in the before hook. There should be a corresponding util for conversations too that Aayush made.",
