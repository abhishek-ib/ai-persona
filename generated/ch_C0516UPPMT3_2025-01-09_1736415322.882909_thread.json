      "message": "Hey team, this is a 2 stage feedback post:\n1. Confusion surrounding user context\n    a. I'm not quite sure how to make which context (org vs personal) the user is in more clear, but I have a data point that suggests that we probably should improve this somehow.\n    b. I was in a call earlier recently with another Instabaser who was looking for a converse conversation they'd previously created, but couldn't find it.  After a considerable amount  of searching, they were frustrated enough that they were going to resort to just starting a new conversation and reuploading the main document they wanted to ask a question of. I suggested that they try switching context to the IB org and it might be there. And sure enough, it was.\n    c. This person has been around IB plenty to have more knowledge about our platform than we could expect of a very proficient user, and yet they didn't notice the distinction in platform behavior between their name and the org name being in the top-left of the page. So I would argue that we need to do more to call out that distinction and help educate users through UI design and perhaps other means.\n2. Search also returns Build projects, Converse conversations, Apps, Chatbots, & Marketplace listings\n    a. One thought that came up out of this frustration was that we have a search product that finds relevant Google docs, files in an S3 bucket, and wherever else is plugged in, but we don't have a good way (that I know of) to search for projects, conversations, etc. within the very same platform. \n    b. If it's not already on our roadmap, we should add the option for our search product to also return relevant results for conversations, deployments, apps, & everything else that lives in AI Hub.\n    c. And naturally, per point #1 above, that search would ideally cross the barrier between the personal account context and their org context, returning all relevant results the user has access to regardless of whether they live in the user's personal account or in an org workspace.",
