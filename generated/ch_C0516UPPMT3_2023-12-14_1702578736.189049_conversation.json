      "message": ":rocket: Feature announcement! (cross-posting from email) :rocket:\n\nStarting in 23.49 (GA planned for Dec 18th), we're excited to announce significant AI Hub platform features that will streamline commercial onboarding and accelerate adoption. These can now be tested on AI Hub preprod (https://aihub.preprod.instabase.com/). We’d love your feedback!\n\n:sparkles:  User can now start an AI Hub commercial trial by themselves:\n• A community user can start a free trial of AI Hub commercial directly from the marketing website by clicking \"Start free trial\"\n• Once a free trial is kicked off, a commercial user will be able to name the organization and invite users to the organization\n• During the free trial, a commercial organization will have access to AI Hub commercial for 14 days and up to $75 worth of free usage\n• Once the trial ends, the org will be disabled until they sign up for a paid version of AI hub (working with our growth sales team)\n• A user will only be able to sign up for one free trial\n• To test this out, create a new preprod account and use this link: https://aihub.preprod.instabase.com/?start_trial=true\n• The website link will only be updated after the deployment is pushed to prod\n:house_buildings: Users can work between their community account and commercial account\n• Once a community user starts a free trial or is added to a commercial org, the user will be able to switch between working in their community account or their commercial account\n• This means that we will NO longer require users to provide an alternate email to be added to a commercial organization\n• The only limitation is that a user can only be in one commercial organization in addition to their community account (this limitation will be removed in the future)\n• At this time, we do not support any migration of data from the community account to the commercial account. This is to ensure that organizations have complete data and user isolation\n:moneybag: Monthly subscription billing & usage is now supported for AI Hub commercial users\n• A commercial customer can sign up to a monthly subscription fee + PAYG consumption\n• Our PAYG consumption will be post-paid meaning that an org can consume as much as they want during the month and we will bill them at the end of the month for their usage\n• A commercial customer can also agree to a unit commitment (prepaid purchase of units) in exchange for rate discounts. If a commercial customer does this, we will also be able to support charging of overages if incurred after they use up the unit commitment\n• All commercial licenses will be tracked in Metronome (a third party platform that allows us to easily adjust plans, set custom rates, and iterate at scale) and all invoicing will be handled through stripe\n:cloud:  AI Hub commercial storage enhancements\n• Admins can mount a s3/blob as an org drive. By doing this, the drive is available in all workspaces. Users can still mount drives at the workspace level\n• Admins can set an org drive as their default drive. All data processed on the platform (across build, converse and app runs) will be stored in the selected default drive. This ensures that the customer remains in control of their data\n• These improvements will be critical for supporting data residency requirements and will be the foundation for supporting our enterprise customer data requirements\nHuge thanks to so many of our EPD team members for making this possible. This was a cross-functional effort that took a village. Thank you in particular to those below and so many more not mentioned:\n• Platform Team: @Cheryl Zhou  @Heymian @Jeff  @Liam Callanan @mfichman @Victor Zeng @Weiming Wu @William Helmrath @Xindi Xu\n• Apps Team: @Adam @andy @avi @Jag @Travis \n• Converse Team: @Balaram @Rakesh @Varun Jain @Vasu\n• Build Team: @Arjun @Bastiane @daniel  @Elan Sharony @Eric Han\n• Design: @alagu @Siya\n• Docs: @Rosie\nWe can’t wait to hear your feedback!",
