Actually, you're running into one of the downsides to using arbitrary forks of the prime repo `instabase/instabase`. :upside_down_face:\n\nI'm testing a fix now, but that takes a while to complete.\n\nIn the meantime, you can:\n1. Push your branch to the upstream/prime repo at `instabase/instabase` (forks don't bring any benefit :slightly_smiling_face:) and then switch the fork in the ICC UI\n2. Rebuild your sandbox as-is, but set the *Advanced* -> *Pipeline Branch* field to `releng-637-rollback`\nI'll update here once the fix (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/59688) is merged!",
