The webpack build runs and the files are in `webserver/shared/build/js/webpacked`, but they're not copied over to `webserver/webapp/build/py/static/js/webpacked`. I finally got it to work by manually changing the makefile to run compile-static-files and copy-static-files in the `build-docker` make command",
