Anything that needs more description or context needs to be ‘reasoning’\n\nFor FinTru, they are trying to get the name of the auditor, and the audit date from a 10K - simple string extraction. But you need to provide info about where in the document to look to find it. Therefore although you’re doing extraction, you still need to use reasoning to get the info you need.",
