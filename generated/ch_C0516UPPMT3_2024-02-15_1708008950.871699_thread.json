      "message": "I've been playing around with the 'custom function' feature in Build. There are couple of quality of life additions that I would've liked:\n1. I don't understand the 'context' argument passed. The docs didn't seem to provide much guidance on this. As far as I can tell the difference between `context` and `context['document text']` is only formatting. Can anyone provide some clarification?\n2. There are no 'save changes'/'discard' buttons - you can only back out using the nested menu at the top\n3. If you have an error in your validation custom function code, the validation result is printed as 'Fail' (see screenshot). This is no different from the case where your code is valid, but the validation test fails (apart from error message printed in the logs). I think the result should be stated as 'error', and even better if the line of code creating the error can be highlighted in red or something",
