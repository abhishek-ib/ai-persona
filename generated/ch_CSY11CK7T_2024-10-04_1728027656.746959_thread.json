      "message": "Hi Team, With 24.04 deployed in JPMC, they have noticed few changes in the behaviour in the refiner app(from Solution builder or otherwise).\n1. While opening the refiner with all records, it used to give a pop-up at the bottom until all records are loaded completely. That pop-up is missing now in 24,04. Is this by design? This cause the user to run the field before all records are loaded as sometimes the user does not know how many records are there.\n2. While running a single field, the pop-up appears showing that the field is running, but it disappears after 2-3 seconds and comes back and it goes on until field run is completed. \nAttaching a video from JPMC env showing the first scenario and 2nd scenario can be seen towards the end of the video.\nticket: https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/8261\ncc: @Sujith",
