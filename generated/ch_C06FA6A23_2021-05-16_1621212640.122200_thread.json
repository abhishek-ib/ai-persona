At a minimum, I think we should have the “platform login” link always go to https",

GCloud LB/Nginx is meant to do a redirect to https for all http traffic\nI'll troubleshoot the login page.\n\nThese problems should ideally go away as we move to the new infrastructure. Both wordpress and product will be behind Instabase nginx server in the new infra.",
