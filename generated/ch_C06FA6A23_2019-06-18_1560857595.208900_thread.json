Given that we have quite a few new people, and also since we just have so many boards available and in-use, it’s not always clear. For instance, when writing down a task for a new feature, I am unsure if it should go into the product’s board, in a checklist within the product backlog, within the priority board, the planning board, my personal weekly snippet, a feature request board, etc… Would be interested in hearing how others decide.",
