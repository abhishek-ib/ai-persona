      "message": "Hey all, I wanted to poll the eng team and see if anyone had any concerns with merging `apps-server` into `webapp`? We started the webserver consolidation effort a couple years ago (that merged `api-server` and `api-server-apps`) and it didn't finish. In an effort to further reduce the complexity of our stack, I think this would be a huge win, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nPros\n• Reduce the complexity of our deployments by getting rid of another service\n• Simplify local development by having one fewer service to bring up\n• Merge resource usage with webapp since usage and code patterns are very similar already.\n• Less vulnerabilities to fix!\n• Might be able to cleanup proxying logic in webapp\nCons\n• Backports from master to older branches touching apps-server will no longer work\n• Searching git history will be a bit more difficult",
