I know a while ago we were discussing 50, but I've seen quite a few important docs like 10Ks that reach 80ish pages. 100 would be a more reasonable limit for us to consider",

      "message": "The size limit exists because of the way we chose to upload files - currently the application chooses to upload the file in one request, which means if the request payload is too large it places the backend services at risk. File service supports multipart upload though, it is just that the document endpoint did not implement this. Furthermore, it is a good practice to limit how much a user can upload anyway because we only have so much resources",

It should be higher, I ran into this a few times with large files (UN sustainable development goals, Adani hindenburg report, HBR case study - all of which were under 25MB, but that is a huge jump).\n2. We should add tips for the user to compress the file if they cross the limit in the error message",
