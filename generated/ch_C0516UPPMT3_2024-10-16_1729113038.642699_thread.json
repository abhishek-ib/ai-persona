      "message": "Hey, just got off a call with ANZ around fraud detection capabilities. They were very happy with the approach we suggested and are already working with Resistant AI. In the long run they'd like an OOTB integration with RAI (they'd actually prefer if we had in-house capabilities but we said that's unlikely), but they are happy with API calls to RAI as upstream connections in a deployment.\n\nI'm not sure which tickets are most relevant to provide this feedback to (maybe these ones: 1 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/EPD-2940?jql=text%20~%20%22resistant%2A%22), 2 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/EPD-2957?jql=text%20~%20%22resistant%2A%22), 3 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/EPD-1892?jql=text%20~%20%22resistant%2A%22)). The two different approaches I suggested were a 2-step review process (RAI -> review -> IB -> review) and a single step (RAI -> IB -> review), of which they preferred the second approach. This is only possible if we can surface the document name in the context argument of functions in Build.\n\ncc @Akshay @Darragh Byrne @Kaustubh (KD)",

      "message": "@Hamish I'd also just like to point out that currently there's not a way for RAI to call our API directly and kick off an app run. We may be able to call RAI directly, though, if we had access to the document binaries. I invited you to a sync with @Darragh Byrne tomorrow where we are planning on discussing similar things. I think a direct integration also gets more complex with legalities and sharing profits, but we can discuss this further tomorrow",

In the second approach this is basically an upstream integration right? (Source --> Logic to send to RAI while also sending the document to IB --> Review results).",
