Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.\n 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).```\nLooks like this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/74000) was merged to address this a few weeks back, I had just pulled from master so those changes are already in.\n\nSeems like there could be a fix here (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C06FA6A23/p1755912403954589?thread_ts=1755741284.222769&cid=C06FA6A23)?
