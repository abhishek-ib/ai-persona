Right now you can only clear the whole chat.\n• Could I share / download a conversation rather than just individual questions, or select the questions & answers I want to export\nWith the new organization feature, I can imagine workflows where a manager says to an analyst - go do some analysis on these docs. The analyst goes into AI Hub, finetunes prompts, and then shares the output (in a word doc) along with a link to the conversation in AI Hub to allow the manager to audit. It positions Converse much more as a co-pilot in team workflows.",

Are there specific instances where you feel this need? \n• Sharing / download of a conversation has been a commonly requested feature, and part of our backlog. Do you see the primary need as collaboration with other team members through a ‘shared edit access’, or are there cases in which a ‘read only access’ would also be useful? FYI, we are prioritising published conversations via chat bots in Q4 which would help address this need partly",
