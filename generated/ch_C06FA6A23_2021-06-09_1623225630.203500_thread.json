I still have to maybe work on providing run time parameters rather than using a static file (i.e. for passwords and rsa keys location). But I can demonstrate this on IB.com (http://IB.com), and I tested it using external public and private key pairs. A good point to review and for me to learn how to deploy as an IB solution maybe (already discussed this with Venkat). The notebook version works too, but more to explain the under the hood approach (i.e. RSA + AES ). Let me know when you want to review this. Thanks",
