      "message": "@Abhishek Adupa @Anil From what we discussed earlier, I looked into whether we can achieve both splitting and selectively showing pages from a PDF while also achieving feature parity with what we currently have - the good news is that I think that we can:\n• We can use the library `react-pdf` to do a bulk of the work (this is already in our codebase)\n• We can replicate scaling and panning with our own JS built on top\n• The hardest part is showing boxes for provenance, but it should be fine. I'm not sure how provenance works nowadays but we might run into issues with the x and y coordinates of the boxes to show (since now we're not splitting up the PDFs, we're just hiding some pages, we can't have provenance use the x and y coordinates using the top left of the PDF), but hopefully we can change how those coordinates are calculated if we run into issues.\n• react-pdf would also work for showing thumbnails as well - we'll just scale PDF pages to a small size. Maybe there could be a performance issue if there are a ton of PDFs though, but it's hard to tell this early on",
