Since the org projects are not supported, after project creation it failed during the document upload and this project was set with invalid data mount path ('user-name/my-repo') instead of 'org-name/user-name'.\n\nWhile trying to delete the project from the UI, the project got deleted from the DB successfully but failed while trying to delete the contents from the File system since the path is invalid.\n\nI will work with the team to figure out a better deletion process.",
