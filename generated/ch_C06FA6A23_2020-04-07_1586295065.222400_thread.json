I am revamping two sheets of mine I live my life by!\n-\nThe first I need a bit of help with to ensure the interviews are properly being split up and newer folks are getting trained:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z6tnYFTPl2R7ht8LbSLbEdzcGt0nqcdtR74ieLp8Odg/edit?usp=sharing. Feel free to add an \"X\" or \"Train\" where you should or shouldn't be across each of the bottom tabs.\n-\nAlso, my personal tracking sheet for candidates is being revamped to include more data behind their process/stats which can then be filtered into each individual team/role for pass-through data for each stage. Look at the tab titled \"TEST SHEET\" for every candidate that will be in our pipeline and each team for when they are hired/rejected/drop: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WZFiqAbZRw5xjgraRBXDqg903XGb61prV9CIq7Lb4ds/edit#gid=0",
