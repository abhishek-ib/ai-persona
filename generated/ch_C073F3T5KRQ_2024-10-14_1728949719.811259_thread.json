      "message": "Hello! I need to build a url to be sent in an email from job-service (for notifications to be sent when a run is at certain points). I'm trying to figure out how to get the host name in that service... a bunch of the webserver ones and license server have INSTABASE_HOSTNAME, but not job-service. Is it okay for me to add it to the deployment config for job-service? If not, does anyone have alternate ideas? Also, is it okay to use config variables in shared-utils/py-utils that may not be in every service, or do I need to make sure I'm just passing them in via the caller of the utils?",

There just hasn't been a need yet, but it's fine to do so.\n\nIf you need to use config variables in py-utils, you always need to pass it in. You can't assume env vars will be set in every service, so it's best to take it as a parameter and force the callers (typically services) to know that they need to read in the env var.",
