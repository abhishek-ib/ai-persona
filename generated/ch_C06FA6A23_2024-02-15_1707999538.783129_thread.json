I understand this feature is in LTS but is it okay to suggest this to the client?\nAre we good in supporting any bugs that may occur?\n\nhttps://instabase.com/docs/24.01/platform-admin/sdlc/index.html\n\ncc: @Aimé @BG @Varun K V @Badri",

We can support critical bugs, but note we haven’t made a single bug fix/code change for this feature in almost 3 years. It’s unclear whether that means no one is using it, or it works sufficiently well out of the box that there are no bugs (I highly doubt it’s the latter given our track record :smile:).",
