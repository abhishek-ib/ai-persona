      "message": "Hi team, I'm working on the Rocket Mortgage project and was previously on the Uber POV. On both project, I've always had to run a new flow to do a Golden comparison. I'm guessing this was originally designed with the thought that new results or changes to the refiner / validation rules would occur for someone to want to do another comparison with the Goldens. However, I find myself often fixing the Goldens or want to quickly compare the Goldens to a completed flow run.\n\nConsidering for a run with only 30 documents, it takes an average of 10 minutes to run through a flow and do the Golden comparison. This would save me hours of time per project that I would usually need to wait for the results from the Goldens.\n\nIs this something that's on the Product / Engineering team's radar?\n\ncc: @Nithin @Piyush @Ganan Prabaharan @Charles",

      "message": "Actually, it looks like they already made a consideration for this, but I think it only works when editing Goldens/GT within the Flow Editor UI, instead of exporting the .xlsx, fixing in a spreadsheet, & reimporting.\n\nIn the screenshot below, notice how the 2nd record from the bottom has an orange value in the Ground Truth column, this is orange because I just edited it.  Then once at least 1 value has been edited, the `Recompute` button shows up between _Compare_ and _Export_.  Then when I hit that, it'll only take a fraction of the total flow time to give me updated metrics.",

      "message": "I often find myself editing the Goldens offline, which tends to be a lot faster than individually editing each value. The above solution only works if you're making edits to the Golden that you are working on and if you have already run the Golden and gotten the performance already.\n\nImagine you just created the Goldens and you want to run it again the run that you created the Goldens from. You'd need to run the same flow again.",

Of course, the improvement will lead to better customer experience via faster delivery times on solutions and POVs and their development experience but this isn't being driven by the customer themselves.",
