The big pain point I was feeling was that I would start to craft a prompt in 1 conversation, then switch over to the other one to reference some wording, then when I got back to the 1st conversation, the draft of my prompt was gone.  It got so bad that I had to draft my prompts in a more persistent window then copy over to converse.",
