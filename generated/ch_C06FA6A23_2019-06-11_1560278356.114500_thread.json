      "message": "Hello engineering friends! I have a ticket for Capital One (do cool kids call them c1?), and I feel like I can repeat some of the words, but I am not yet familiar enough with Instabase to even reproduce. Would anyone be willing to take a quick call with me to go over https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/314? Specifically, the problem statement is “Is it possible, without copy and pasting, to open and load the raw ocr text from a .ibocr file into a previously built refiner program?“.",

      "message": "hey will and @john the way I do this is:\n\n1) Look at the output directory for Process Files and find the “texts” folder. Grab the .txt file in “texts” (the filename will correspond to the IBOCR file they are looking at)\n\n2) Copy paste that text into a row in Refiner (the bottom-most row)\n\n3) Then you can Run Refiner and save your program again\n\nFYI @Jesika Haria on things we can make more usable about the product\n\nFYI @will",
