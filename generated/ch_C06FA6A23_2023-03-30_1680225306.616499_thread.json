I'm aware of this guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMNxhIu3py_qZhuSxxOHJLet3jUg_hDkaEhjkQ0XO2c/edit#heading=h.cywwkdu31rt3) but I've been having alot of trouble actually seeing my traces, especially when code is being executed in a separate thread through `ThreadPoolExecutor` . Is there a way to test my changes w/o having to deploy to a sandbox?",
