Is this expected or is there an actual bug?\n    ◦ https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/14993/overview/8cf54601-81d4-4643-a50d-[…]y?att=1&roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1&ts=1729701547180 (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/14993/overview/8cf54601-81d4-4643-a50d-fc26b931a517/replay?att=1&roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1&ts=1729701547180)",
