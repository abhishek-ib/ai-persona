Quick update for last week:\n\n\t1.\t*Results API Changes* - Need to implement; Hannah confirmed the changes.\n\t2.\t*License Bug* - Can you review the PR? PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/66025)\n\t3.\t*Job Table Migration* -\n\t     •\t*Done*: Migration, migration tests, accessor, main code changes for writes and updates, and testing.\n\t     • *Pending*: Need to modify reads.\n\t4.\t*Fix List Jobs Query* - thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CV8V33RPV/p1733867311590289) PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/66181)\n\t     •\tIssue: For AXA, there’s an upstream Azure system that sets the job-id as a mixed-case string, but our job-id DB query converts the query to lowercase, causing results not to appear.\n\t     •\tFixed in PR, but the PR was held up because Andy and Matt suggested implementing case-insensitive search.\n\t     •\tWorked with Matt to implement for case-insensitive search, but Kerry suggested not merging the PR since other customers might rely on the current search behavior.\n\t5.\t*New Issue* - Spent time debugging but couldn’t root cause yet: FLOW-10515 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/FLOW-10515).\n\t6.\t**ACTION ITEM*** *Update Jira*  - Docs team (@Chris Cowell) reached out regarding updates on two tickets EPD- 3194 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3194), EPD-3110 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3110?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZDI5ZTY4OGY4MTA5NDIyMGEwN2E4Yjk0NGI3NTZkNjMiLCJwIjoiamlyYS1zbGFjay1pbnQifQ). Since these are not complete and need to be pushed, he asked to add a note explaining the delay and for the version label to be updated. I’m unsure what reason to provide—can you please update it?\n\nI’ll be online, please let me know if I should do anything. Thanks again Anil.\n\nCan you also move our 1:1 from Monday to Wednesday ?",
