      "message": "The chatbot is good overall, but potentially limited by the fact that it can't explicitly pull knowledge in from the copyrighted D&D books, like the Dungeon Master's Guide or Xanathar's Guide to Everything.  I had my wife (who's also an avid D&D player) try it out, and she was impressed, but quickly ran into these limitations.\n• Screenshot 1 covers a specific gameplay mechanic that is in the DMG, which AI Hub handled well by only answering from the source text while indicating that a better answer is available in the DMG, likely due to GPT's general knowledge.\n• Screenshot 2's question mentions a playable character race only found in the Spelljammer book.  While the answer is good and based 100% on the source text, it kinda doesn't take into account the fact that she specifically asked about a _Plasmoid_ Ranger, as that answer would equally apply to any Ranger.\n• Screenshot 3 meanwhile gave a bit of an odd answer, starting with an evaluation of sorts about the actual answer provided below.\nOverall, I think this chatbot is ready for public consumption, mainly being limited by our inability to add copyrighted material on a public chatbot.  Perhaps in any promotion around this, we can encourage people to create their own converse sessions (conversations?) adding more of their own books for a more comprehensive knowledge base.  Relatedly, do we currently have a feature on our roadmap to allow users to fork a published chatbot, such as taking this one and uploading more PDFs to its databank?",
