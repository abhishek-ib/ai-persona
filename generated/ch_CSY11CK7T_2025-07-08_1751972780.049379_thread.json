      "message": "Hey Team, AXA-UK is reporting that they are not able to open the review link for app-runs for randomly submitted input emails(with pdfs and/or xlxs as attachment). We see a error in console log of course when the page breaks. What we figured further was, almost all of these runs that do not load, had xlxs file as email file attachment. Others, with just pdf as attachment to the input email file are loading well in review. Another observation from the team, this was working last week. So may be something changed lately?",
