      "message": "Hey Team, In our python services, we have each service overriding the  `config.BaseConfig`  fields even when the default has the exact same value. Is there a reason for this pattern or is this a remnant of refactor that needs to be cleaned up? I would actually suggest making this similar to our golang services where the config is split into sub configs such as cache, tracing etc which would make it easier to maintain.",
