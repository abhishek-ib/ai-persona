I think there’s two types of configs in that file. 1. configs for our random sandboxes (what victor is adding to), the there’s the shared sandboxes for CI/CD (sandbox-azure, release-22.01.0). I think the CI/CD ones should stop using your personal email, but to do that, we need to build a system-test setup script to automate the creation of all required dependencies. But for the team testing sandboxes, that really doesn’t matter much.\n\nThat being said, Victor, you can go ahead and create an account using <mailto:core-infra@instabase.com|core-infra@instabase.com> or <mailto:core-services@instabase.com|core-services@instabase.com>. That’s the group with just our team on it, so you’ll get notifications/emails from there.",
