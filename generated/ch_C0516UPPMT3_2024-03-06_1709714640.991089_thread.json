      "message": "I have gotten better results with a bit of prompt engineering, separating the information that is needed from how it should be presented. Ie:\n`Extract all the readings from the documents. Format it as a pie chart of the reading results`\n\n`Extract all the readings from the documents. Format it as a table with columns Date, Time and Reading`\n\nFor the ‘incorrect response’ bit I agree it’s confusing I have an existing task (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/DR-2955) to improve that.\n\nAs a final note Converse as is structured today is better suited for answering questions that require locating few pieces of information across the documents, rather to aggregate all the information present. We have build features like list extraction, and multiple object extraction that are much better suited for a task like this.",
