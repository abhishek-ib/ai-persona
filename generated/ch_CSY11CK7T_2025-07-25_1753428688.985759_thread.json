      "message": "im curious to bring up the idea of introducing a fe-pr channel or something similar so we have a designated channel for just dealing with PR? kind of a channel where people just post the PR link and anyone they might wanna tag.\n\ni feel its faster and more efficient than gmail/github notifications especially on the mobile side and ez to tag/share w others not on the review list. Also with the better UI it'd be easier to reply directly on slack than add comments to a PR if someone has a question/need another review (outside of the actual code review). Sometimes as a new joiner i do like to look through people's past PRs just to get a sense of how people code and learn about the codebase or sometimes ask questions. Feel it wouldn't hurt to let non-reviewers review a PR voluntarily~ any thoughts?",
