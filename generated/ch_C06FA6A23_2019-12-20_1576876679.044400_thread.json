See this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gev72qg1VVdpjOQzlV_J6Bke7VvM570mnVecE-GLivg/edit?folder=1tuDu6TfwGxc2Vi2alG4w6ufqdfIFdPPe#\n\nWe’re going to be making interactive code examples and videos for various topics. What I ask of you:\n\n1. Can you identify topics not listed under “Guides” that you’d like to see? If so, please add it to the doc\n2. Do you want to contribute material in the form of videos or code examples? Please reach out!\n3. Can you think of other ways we can help engineers onboard to this material besides videos and code walkthroughs?\ncc: @Jonathan Shih @shaunak who expressed early interest in creating this material.\ncc: @Aaron Vontell @lydia @Aaron Tami + others who likely will want to create such topics for your particular area of expertise\ncc: @achao @Kerry @Felicia @abhilash @arun who might have topics they’d like to request for Python learnings",
