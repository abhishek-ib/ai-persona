Vendor shall inform Company, as soon as possible, of any advanced threat that Vendor discovers on such workstations or servers that was not previously detected by any of the Vendor’s deployed virus and malicious code detection and protection measures.  By way of example, and not limitation, an “advanced threat” may be software, firmware, code or script intended to perform an unauthorized process with the potential to adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system via backdoors, malicious active content, worms, key loggers or other processes that are designed to cause undesired effects or to continuously monitor and extract data.",
