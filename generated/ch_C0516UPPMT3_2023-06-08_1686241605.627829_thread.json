      "message": "Hi @arun - I tried the queries on `all-active-support-tickets-closed-view-2023-06-06-1136.csv` file. Here are the results I got.\n\n1. For the 1st question `Find ticket count that were created in May` - advanced model returned `81` . Is that answer correct? Basically, model tried to look for dates b/w 1st May and 31st May. Pandas query was `df['ID'].loc[(df['Requested'] >= '2023-05-01') & (df['Requested'] <= '2023-05-31')].count()` to come up to that answer.\n2. For the 2nd question `Calculate the ticket count requested in May` - advanced model returned `90` . The pandas query used for this was `df['Requested'].loc[df['Requested'].dt.month == 5].count()` in short if the month is `5` i.e. May.\nNow, the reason behind why both of these answers are different is, The first query is not counting the tickets created _*after*_ 31st May 00:00:00. There are `9` tickets which were created after `2023-05-31` 00:00:00 time. Hence, first query is not counting it.\n\n3rd question was correct as you said.\n\nRegarding the 4th question, the reason it's not working for \"Natwest\" was, it was trying to search for \"Natwest\" but in the CSV it's \"Nat*W*est\" - so, it was a case-sensitive issue. See the screenshot for results for question if we ask the same question with \"NatWest\".\n\nAlso see the screenshots attached for 1st, 2nd and 4th question answers for more details.\ncc: @Hari",
