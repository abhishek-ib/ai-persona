Then you will run that service using your Python3 venv (since the run-local.sh script will be using the Python3.6 interpreter).\n\nIn contrast, our services run in Python2 and you should use your venv setup for Python2 for those.\n\nIf you want to experiment with “how does my service run in Python3”, you can do:\n\nmake build runlocal USE_PY3=true\n\nIn order to see if that takes effect, make sure to check out the Makefile to determine that USE_PY3 has been implemented for runlocal. An example of an implemented runlocal USE_PY3=true is here (app-tasks) or here (apps-server)",
