It was amazing working with you all - it's really cool how we have such a tight-knit, cohesive frontend team, and I hope you all continue that far into the future. I know you all have got this, but if there's ever a time where there's something I worked on and I can save you a couple hours of your time with a little of mine screen sharing, please reach out. Stay in touch - maybe we'll cross paths again!",
