It's not an automated process yet, we can work that part out - but doing it earlier on code cut days seems like it would regain some of the UAT window that Wednesday certifications will lose.",

I think the main thing to note is the Wed build in the middle of UAT week is going to be a half-baked/likely-buggy. So we need to ensure that if there's a pre-prod deploy, it needs to use the wed release from the week after, the exact same one that prod will get (which is the correct thing to do).",
