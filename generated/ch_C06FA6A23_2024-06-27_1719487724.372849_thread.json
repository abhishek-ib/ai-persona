As part of the Central Observability project (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pG5SGpn8QB6DV-ndtJ1BYzppCUyL4-rjc08JT9ELemw/edit?pli=1), the Observability team is trying to centralize the logs to a single region. But some of the services currently log user PII data and customer inputs into the logs and it's a blocker. Team needs help with the service owners to scrub the logs to clear customer data.  @Rakesh @Anil @andy @lydia @Balaram Can you all pls help assign some reps from your teams who can help with respective services/components? cc: @HH\n\nMeanwhile @HH can you also list some examples or any analysis that you have done that captures PII data in logs?",
