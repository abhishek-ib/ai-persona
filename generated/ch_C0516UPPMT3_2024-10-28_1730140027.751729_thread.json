      "message": "Hi Team,\n\nDuring project creation file splitting is automatically turned off. So when creating multiple classes, a multi file document is of course classified as only one class. Have we considered/is it in the pipeline to include the file splitting option during project creation alongside the 'tables, checkboxes' options? Or when a second class is added prompt the user to check if they would like to turn file splitting on?",
