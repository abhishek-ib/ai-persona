They would need any of the models used for field extractions, classifications, summarizations, etc. in analyze and automate contexts.\n• LLM model(s) and specific versions used\n• OCR model and specific version used\n• Any DL model and version (table extraction)\n• Any translate model/image/version\n• Nice to have: ability to tag results with external models integrated through REST calls\nIf not, I'll get a PFR open.",
