They call out to the Flow API to schedule the Flow and then wait for the Flow to complete.  Now, the newly schedule flow won’t have any any more tasks where they can execute.\n\nThe only case where this would be OK is when you are actually not waiting on the Flow to complete, but then state management becomes really complicated.",
