      "message": "*Cypress on-call summary for Feb 10-14* :cypress-spin:\n• :white_check_mark: `results-table` & other tests using `runCurrentApp` weren’t checking for loading state of workspaces, fixed with https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67926\n• :white_check_mark: `aihub-derived-field` was failing b/c of Pollen color changes, fixed by referencing theme colors https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67930\n    ◦ Related - unit tests also failing due to color changes https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1739256108639919\n• :white_check_mark: `review-manager-dashboard` can fail if reviewer isn’t the 5th column of the table, fixed w/ `findByRole` instead of relying on column index https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/67973\n• :information_source: `Error: Cannot create styled-component for component: undefined.` on their some live tests, fixed by rebasing + deleting & re-generating the cypress crafting sandbox for PR. Caused by creating the cypress sandbox before some imports from Pollen were renamed & rerunning cypress after a rebase.\n• :question: `upstream-integration` has been failing bc of the same error mentioned from last week @Jessica\n• :x: `aihub-refinement` sometimes fails due to `line_type` error. Seems like an issue w/ line index stored in state not staying in sync w/ schema but unsure what the root cause is.",
