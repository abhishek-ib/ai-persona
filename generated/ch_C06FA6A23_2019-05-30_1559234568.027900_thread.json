They just reported this behavior to me: After they copied our latest flow to their Instabase and changed the flow name to whatever they need, their API still somehow invoked the old flow. They manually refreshed Instabase’s webpage multiple times from the browser, then it worked (new flow was invoked). :exploding_head:\n\nIs this even possible? Like there’s some sort of delay time between a flow is uploaded and it is invokable by the API?",
