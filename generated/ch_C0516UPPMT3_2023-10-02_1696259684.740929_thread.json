      "message": "Also its not clear to me when uploading your first set of documents that you need to click on the three dots to manually add a class. During demos people are generally very impressed on the auto classification we do when first adding documents, and that the platform then ‘learns’ from your corrections to its estimated class names. Is this something we can bring back with the updates to build?",

      "message": "With classification, we got lots of feedback that people would like classification suggestions instead of auto-classification. So the design changed to provide suggestions instead of classify right away.\n\nI think in this case tho the class suggestion flow is not implemented consistently? @Natasha @Serena when people click on the 3 dots to create classes, they don't see the popup (in screenshot) that shows the suggestion, instead they directly created a class that's the first suggestion (it seems). Is this a bug? Ideally they see the same thing.\n\nAlso on the class suggestion result, we should replace `_` with space\n\nI agree that it's not very clear to click on the 3 dots to create classes, we can improve that.\n\ncc @lydia @alagu",

I think there are 2 issues:\n• When you first click \"Create classes\", we prompt the user to fill in a class name, and there is no design to show suggested classes.\n• When you click \"Add class\" before classifying documents for the first time, we don't show any class suggestions.",
