      "message": "Hey team,\nWhile working on vulnerability management, I noticed that after migrating our Go services to use the common Dockerfile, it has limited our ability to customize the build of third-party dependencies.\n\nFor example, in *Weaviate*, we need to manage versions of certain dependencies for vulnerability management. However, I couldn’t find a way to handle this without creating a separate Dockerfile specifically for Weaviate.\n\nDo we have a better approach for customizing builds of third-party images, or is maintaining a separate Dockerfile (like the one I’ve created in this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/73871)) the right way to go?\nWe’ve already been using similar customizations for other third-party images such as *VictoriaMetrics*.\n\ncc: @sudeep @mfichman",
