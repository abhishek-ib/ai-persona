      "message": ":wave: :dancing-penguin: *Hello!!*\nWant faster sandbox builds (on non-release branches for now)??? Well here we go! :smile:\n\nWe just merged an enhancement (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/57859) to the sandbox deployment pipelines that adds an *opt-in* toggle for using the new build infrastructure we presented to EPD last month - and it _should_ yield substantial build time improvements overall! :dancing-panda:\n\nIf you'd like to try it out and help us load test the new build infrastructure, you can do so with a small bit of JSON added to the *`Advanced Args`* section of the Admiral UI when you build / update your sandboxes:\n```{\n  \"LEGACY_SVC_BUILD\": false\n}```\nIf you run into any issues, simply remove that line (or set it to `true`, either way) and your next build will revert to the old build infra. Just be sure to let us know over in <#C035SLYCJ9X|> so that we can investigate and work out any kinks!\n\n*Notes!*\n1. By default, nothing has changed for sandbox builds - you *must opt-in if you want to use it.*\n2. None of this has been backported anywhere, so if you want to try it out you will need to rebase to a master commit later than this PR.\n3. You might find that the initial build of a sandbox isn't any faster, but rebuilds are very fast. This is expected for now, as the new build pattern performance gains are expected to be amortized over lots of builds over the first bit of time.\n4. Telemetry incoming! I don't have a _great_ visualization of performance comparison yet, but will work on one in the coming days.",
