      "message": "Hey team, I've been working on a POV and I'm finding the new separation of schema and validations quite high friction. In the example screenshot I want to add multiple validations to each of the fields, so having all the validations shown in a list instead of being nested within each field as we had before makes it confusing and hard to quickly see which validations I have on which fields. I think it makes more sense for them to split up by field rather than by rule names (I am using identical validations across multiple different fields e.g. check this is a valid date format)",

      "message": "@Hamish out of curiosity— you mention that you’re using the same validation function  across multiple fields — do you somehow find that this new split makes it more difficult to achieve this? \n\nMy thinking would be that as we introduce more complex validation types, ie classification validations, validations across multiple fields etc, having all the rules in a central place will be an easier way to manage rules and it actually will make less sense for them to primarily live inside the field editor. Maybe the difficulty currently is in identifying the rules within the validations tab? @Natasha @Jianqi Xing do you think the newer designs for validation rules will address these concerns?",

      "message": "Thanks @Arjun. My thinking is essentially that when I create a project I add an extraction, some cleaning, and some validation for the specific task at hand. Therefore, as I'm designing solutions I see the validations being tied to fields rather than classes (according to Ai Hub's current capabilities at least). So having created a field, then backing out to the validations tab to add a validation to that field doesn't make for a flow that makes sense to me.\n\nWhen I want to assess validations that I have in my project, again I do this at a field level not a class level. So exposing all validations for the whole class to me as I'm checking my validations and which have passed or failed as I edit them feels confusing as well. This is compounded when the underlying names and functionality are the same for multiple validations that are applying the same logic to different fields",

I think your second point about using the same functions across fields points more towards being able to reuse validation functions which is actually a place where I think something like the validations library tab could be an advantage.",
