      "message": "Hi team - not sure if this is the right forum for this but I wanted to know if we have done anything similar to the below for other customers? BofA is asking if this is possible:\n\n*Use Case: Real-time service to provide response in the service call for when the customer is uploading a document*\n1. Customer will submit a document\n2. Instabase will classify the document (and possibly extract the year) to ensure they are submitting the correct document. \n3. If document is incorrectly classified, a real time response will be sent to customer notifying them to upload the correct document/year-form\n1 & 2 i know we can do but what would we need to know/advise in order to do no. 3?\n\nThere is also an ask to see if this use case can also provide the feedback of the image quality — I believe with the help of word level confidence scoring we can do that to indicate whether the document being uploaded by the customer is of useable quality for Instabase.",
