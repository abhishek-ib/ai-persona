      "message": ":blob_excited: very exciting news about our company-level strategy from Anant today! hopefully, this doesn't come as too much of a surprise given my overview of what we discussed during the EPD leads offsite\n\n:zoom: if you didn't catch Anant's talk during company all-hands, i highly recommend watching the recording!\n\nto reiterate Anant's and KD's points from company all-hands:\n• short-term: our product priorities and projects won't change\n    ◦ our enterprise customers have many feature requests that are necessary for them to be able to build their own document processing solutions (ex: case management, heuristic classification, etc)\n• long-term: there are still many open questions, but at a high level, we want to make our automation workflow capabilities more flexible and extensible, given the rise of MCP\nhappy to answer more questions in our 1:1s! if it's helpful, we can also try to schedule a special session with Anant / PMs to answer any questions!",
