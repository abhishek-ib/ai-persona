Provenance is very weak in chat app, since the answers are free flowing and may not be extracted from a single place vs build app where we have better provenance since we are looking at particular values which is most often the case in most solutions we build.\n3. Long docs are supported in chat app i.e we retrieve relevant chunks required to answer a user query vs no support currently for long docs in build mode.",
