Might be better suited to a lunch & learn dedicated to that topic than flow (even though a few of them are hidden in flow)\n\nEven seemingly simple strategies like @Anant’s way of sending just a text file into a flow as input and side-loading the rest of the data for the Galileo POC are extremely useful and not always obvious :blush:",
