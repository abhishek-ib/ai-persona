This was born out of my frustration of writing UDFs on our website, and I was thinking that this would be a tool for our power users / Instabase devs. In the demo file you can see the current abilities - writing UDFs locally, executing them using the CLI or VSCode, seeing exceptions, and few other cool things. If you think this is useful or have any ideas, feel free to add to this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HfZsZFiuey81Wchz8H3PNalRl-9JtjdW4N42RoXtlxw/edit?usp=sharing",
