      "message": "i’m not sure where to start this discussion, but here goes! :sweat_smile:\n\nas mentioned during Q&A for the tech talk on Monday, it’s inconvenient for product engineers to use a fresh MySQL db in their dev environment\n• setting up AI Hub for a fresh db is difficult (example (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1733778752131259))\n    ◦ this is currently not captured in the new eng onboarding doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQOCxOISV_ukUxXdPJDoN-rERtOhdVRe7zv1swF1igw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ozg2l97f461a) btw\n• reproducing bugs will take a while if we have to reproduce every bug from scratch on our dev environment\n• the problem is even worse for indexes for AI Hub Search\nideally, product engineers can use a deployed environment’s db / indexes in their dev environment\n• we can already use dogfood.instabase.com (http://dogfood.instabase.com)’s db, which is nice since it already has the necessary users / models / etc for running AI Hub\n• however, it’d even more ideal if we could use the db from an actual AI Hub environment (ex: crafting-aihub.test.instabase.com (http://crafting-aihub.test.instabase.com))\n    ◦ this way, if a product engineer is able to reproduce a bug on crafting-aihub, they don’t need to re-create the bug scenario in their dev environment -> they can directly fix the bug and test the fix in their dev environment since they’re using the same db as crafting-aihub\ni’ve asked multiple people about this over the years, but it seems that our SaaS sandbox dbs are in a VPC that prevents external network access - however, i’m hoping we can make an exception for 1 AI Hub sandbox?\n\nthis would make eng onboarding even simpler for product engineers and would speed up debugging a lot :pray:",

      "message": "I think the problem with this though is that many product eng also make changes to the db schema for various features they are building, and having in-development changes hit a shared database is also a bad idea. \n\nI think a nicer option is if there’s a way to clone the aihub dogfood database (periodically) so that you have access to real data, but you also won’t risk taking down everyone’s environment with a bad database change.",
