It keeps on failing on install-ib-platform (https://jenkins.instabase.com/job/SAAS-AWS/job/saas-pipelines/job/install-ib-platform/21012/console).\nIt has broken the aihub-sandbox (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/) completely.\nCc: @Balaram <!subteam^S02FJA6A7U5>",

      "message": "I dont think what put aihub-sandbox into a bad state is related to the testing earlier today.\n\nTesting was canarrying an image for conversion-service in aihub-sandbox and then running the PIAs to confirm it was working, but since it failed, the next deploy cleaned up the image change (which it did based on DM (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/deployment-manager/dashboard/deployments/apps/v1/conversion-service/deployment-conversion-service-7dbdbb74bd-gq2cd))\n\nWhat caused the wider breakage was this deploy earlier today (https://jenkins.instabase.com/job/SAAS-AWS/job/deploy-saas-aws-preprod/33239/parameters/) where Elasticache was re-enabled. Based on the error I found in api-server `Error: secret \"elasticache-auth-token\" not found`, this led me to a thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CCY413CSU/p1736541977634429?thread_ts=1736498163.984299&cid=CCY413CSU) suggesting we need to delete the patch created to enable Elasticache. I will go ahead and delete that patch and hopefully things turn up properly again\n\ncc @Anil",
