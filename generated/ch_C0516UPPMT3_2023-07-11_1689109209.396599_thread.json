      "message": "When using the Invoice app, the \"Sub_total\" field and \"Total_Tax\" fields populated with a values that are nowhere to be found on the document. When I loaded the same document in Converse and tried to get the \"total tax\" it provided the proper explanation, but the math doesn't add up. This app was just promoted today with a blog post and LinkedIn promotion, yet it is providing inaccurate, inconsistent results and the inability to fix the incorrect values.",

I'm also not very sure if the commercial invoice app should be used on a hotel receipt (sample invoices look quite different from hotel receipt) -- might be good to clarify that",

      "message": "This a great example of the types of basic validations we should prioritize in our apps before businesses are going to pay to use them. Many of our use cases, especially invoices, rely on math to validate that we have extracted the correct information. When we present this in an app (that we're promoting through our marketing and social channels), we should have some ability to score the confidence of the information we are returning and ensure we're not making up data and populating fields. Even if we excuse the poor math handling of Chat GPT, how do we explain populating a field with information that is nowhere to be found on the document? An error would be preferable to completely incorrect information.\n\nIn the converse app, I received three different answers when I asked it for the total tax. I recognize I used slightly different prompts, but they are all returned the wrong information -- with no indication that it is a low confidence answer.",
