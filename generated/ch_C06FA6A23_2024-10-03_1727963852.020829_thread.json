      "message": "Hi everyone, wanted to announce the new features that have come to Admiral (both sandbox and prod ICC) in the past few weeks\n• TPAM requests can now be made directly from prod ICC using the “Request AWS Access” button at the top right of the tenant details page. Some of the required values are pre-filled based on the tenant + user\n• Maintenance schedules specific to a tenant can be viewed in a new tab on the tenant details page. You can manually run schedules from here\n• Some features of the AI Hub admin dashboard are now available in ICC, including the ability to change an org’s tier and view an org on the platform as an admin. This is accessible from a new tab on the tenant details page (AI Hub tenants only)\n• Tenants can now be filtered on the tenant manager page based on the platform (AI Hub or legacy) and how configs are managed (Argo CD or Deployment Manager)\n• New sandboxes built off of up-to-date custom branches are now managed by Argo CD by default. This can be changed in the advanced args if necessary\nPlease send any bugs/feedback to <#C049CQMD2AX|>!",
