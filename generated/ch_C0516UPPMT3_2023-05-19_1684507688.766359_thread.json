      "message": "Just a minor piece of user feedback as I was using AI Hub -\n\nConverse app is intuitive and most people already know how this works, but for building, once a user clicks 'Start building', it would be nice to have some sort of indication on how build mode works. (I know there are step 1,2,3 text slides when creating the project but for all the visual learners out there I think I totally just glossed over the text content). Right now once you click create project, all the user sees is 'Step 1: upload files', and at least for me, I didn't want to upload any of my files without understanding what exactly it's going to do with it. It would be nice to see some sort of 'walkthrough highlight tutorials' would show up first where a highlight area encompasses the upload section, and clicking 'next' would move the highlighted section to the where all the suggested fields or classes that would be extracted would appear etc",
