Does anyone know why the CI/the tests might be failing https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/51827/files?\n\nWhat I did is `npm install moment@latest`\nNow im running `make build && make test` locally to test this and half of the snapshots fail\n\nCan anyone help?",

That helped with the snapshots failing, but I think the CI is now failing just from the normal unit tests? https://jenkins.instabase.com/job/instabase/job/PR-51827/7/console. From the logs I also dont think this is related to my version bump? But maybe someone who knows more can confirm",
