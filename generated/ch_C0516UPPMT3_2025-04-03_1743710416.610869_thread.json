      "message": "Sharing interesting feedback from Kering about review/workspace permissions cc: @jack.robbins @andy\n• Kering has strict data privacy requirements where one brand/location can't see another brand/location lease agreements\n• The current workflow they want is:\n    ◦ A financial controllers will start an AI Hub deployment run (either through a third party system that makes an API call to AI Hub) or manually in AI Hub\n    ◦ Once the run is complete, the financial controller will review the data for correctness\n    ◦ The financial controller should only see the runs from their brand/team and should be able to reference them again\n• The challenge is that to enforce strict data permissions, they will need to create 200+ workspaces with 200+ deployments (one deployment per workspace)\n    ◦ This will ensure that a run is only assigned visible to someone from that specific brand/team\n    ◦ Without this, any financial controller could be assigned to review any run\n• Their ideal state to not create 200 workspaces/deployments and only create 1 workspace/1 deployment for the lease agreement use case. To do this they would need:\n    ◦ Reviewer to be assigned via API (so it can be assigned to the person who initiated the run or from someone in the department) or if run manually the reviewer is assigned to the person running the app\n    ◦ Those users can only see the runs they reviewed (and can reference them once marked as complete); they should not be able to see any other runs",
