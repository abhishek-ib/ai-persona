      "message": "I haven't noticed any slowdown  with git, but I would like to take a moment to recommend using The Silver Searcher (binary name: `ag`) instead of either `git grep` , ack, or regular grep. It works even outside of git repos, is blazing fast (it automatically skips `.git` directories, as well as anything listed in `.gitignore` among other things), and allows you to do stuff like  `ag --python foo` to recursively search only python files for foo. Install it on any mac with `brew install the_silver_searcher`  . Another alternative is ripgrep (`rg`) which is even faster, but it doesn't have the built-in file-type support which is really just super nice.",
