Based on our research so far, they are much more likely to use AI hub in their work setting on a laptop / desktop than mobile.\n\nI believe that we can (and should) figure out a chat experience on mobile post the initial launch, which would be an important addition for casual consumers. We have not come across any users who want to build repeatable apps (builder) on mobile so far.\n\n@Kerry @alagu",
