We actually went through this thought process when deciding what to do with app runs when unmounting a drive, and we’ve basically decided that app runs metadata persists in that case.\n\nWhat we can do via API is delete the actual output folder from the filesystem which is where all PII is stored. In that case you would still see the run in the table UI but when you clicked the results link you would get an error that the data can’t be found",
