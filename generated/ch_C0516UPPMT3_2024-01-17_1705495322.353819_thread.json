Happy to share the project creds via DM if anybody on the team wants to see the customer samples.",

Regardless --\n• TDF will GA in 24.02 that enables us to extract tables without the limitations of model context window. \n• UDF will GA in 24.04 that can also enable reshaping / formatting out of context stuff \n• Further, we can swap to use gpt3.5-16k in 24.04 or later; that might help too  \nThese can't help them _right now_ :confused: I can brainstorm options with you @Varun Jain offline.",
