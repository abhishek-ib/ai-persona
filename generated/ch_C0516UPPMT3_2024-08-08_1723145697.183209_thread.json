Otherwise I need to scroll back to the top of my conversation to see the button and get back to my file list.\n\nIf we do edit it, can we also change the hover label text from *Open File Panel* to *Open file panel* (sentence case) and possibly move it to the left side of the screen to match where it displays from. If something was previously on the left, Iâ€™m looking to the left to re-expand it.",

When the conversation has some messages, the icon does keep floating.\nSounds good will also update the text.\nFor the position change to left side, I'll defer to the design team for their views on this - cc @tj.serkes",
