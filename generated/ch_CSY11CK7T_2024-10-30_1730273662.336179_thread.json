      "message": "Thanks for sharing this @Serena @lydia. These observations and feedback is really useful. I’ve replied to some of them.\n> recently we’ve been seeing some flakiness (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJCAzgBNDtBfb2Ow2pXOvLTyAx1wnImXxPmdpKy-6NM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kegnr61wyy8o) on grafana for logs/traces\nMany of these issues arise because our observability databases are scaled lower compared to other workloads to save resources. We only scale up when a load increase occurs due to incoming queries, which can lead to user timeouts in those situations.\n> i think the grafana UI is slightly hard to use\nI suggest starting with Grafana Fero to assess its usability; if it covers most of our frontend observability needs, it simplifies cost and distribution story. If we find key features missing compared to Sentry, we can then figure out the next steps. let’s discuss it in detail tomorrow.",
