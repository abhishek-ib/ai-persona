      "message": "*Feedback on table extraction on excel files* from Axa account team (thanks @Yatharth Vardan)\n\nWHAT WORKS WELL\n1. LLM is able to identify the structure of the document as spreadsheet or excel sheet.\n2. Identification of table , is clean and precise.\n3. Multi Line Column names are identified precisely.\n4. Empty cells are identified correctly\n5. Identification of table is  possible , even if the table on the sheet , starts after multiple headers /  merged cells with info in them.\n6. In cases of multi header tables - the LLM will pick up the lowest level of Column provided as the column name for the table.\n7. Documents with multiple table is identified precisely.\nWHAT DOES NOT WORK\n1. Multiple Sheet excel files , is difficult to be identified by LLM\n2. LLM is not able to differentiate between two different sheets/ sections\n3. Count of table is inconsistent.\n4. Column names become inconsistent at the breaking point.\n5. Extracting the ith table from n tables\n6. If there is empty rows , in between successive tables, The LLM will keep the rows as is.\n7. If successive tables , have a different number of columns and starting position of the tables, the extracted table will be in accordance with the first Table columns, Columns extending out of The first table boundaries , will be ignored.\nOverall document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xvtgqtbd-7xCzMAzbcCK9h-3V_EqTVT3oxofrL7bQaU/edit#heading=h.s8wg69rasthe\n\nI’ve requested @Yatharth Vardan to share a recording of the documents which are not working well.\ncc: @Lalit @Rakesh @Vishnu Nair @Piyush",
