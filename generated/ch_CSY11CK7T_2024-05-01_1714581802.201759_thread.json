      "message": "Hey team, I’m looking at this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/52228) which I was not aware of, which flags the v2 flow editor as deprecated. In the description I see that this was intended to go into the release notes, but this does not appear to have happened. Did we signal to customers that we are deprecating flow v2 at some point as well as v1 (I’ve heard only about v1 internally and in the release notes), and if so, can someone point me to a timeline or discussion on this point? cc @Jessica",

The idea is the old editor that creates the old version of flow will be deprecated; please use the new editor. We will support running the old version of flows probably forever but will no longer support creating / editing them. Any concerns about this?",

We have not been relaying to customers at all anything about flow v2 (our documentation _only_ mentions flow v1), while we have been relaying info about flow v1. I will check with BofA (the main client still using v2) to see what their editing intentions are, but given their nature my presumption is they will say they need to keep it. Given that BofA is in a weird spot with professional services as well at the moment, it will be difficult to push them to migrate their existing flows imo.",
