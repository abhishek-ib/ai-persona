      "message": "Hi team, for deployments we have the option of a connected drive for upstream integrations. We can also choose to pull in files whenever new ones are found in the input folder i.e. S3 bucket folder Some feedback/questions I have:\n1. How close to real time do we expect this to happen? \n2. I've been trying it out and it looks like 2-3mins lag time between uploading a file and seeing the run in AI Hub. Is there a way to force a refresh or check of the connected drive? (The demo I'm building is for a real-time use case where they will want a fast turnaround time)\n3. What if I want to send through a batch of docs? If I upload a folder of docs this doesn't get pulled through (I'd expect them to be pulled through as a batch perhaps?)\n4. What if there is already files in the connected drive upon connection? There seems to be a similar lag in this case also",
