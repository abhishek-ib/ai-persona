Very positive first signs, and already got a couple of prospects asking for a demo on it. Wanted to share a few points of feedback on top of that:\n• Would be great to have the option for it to detect the language, or translate from multiple languages within one doc to one consistent language.\n• Preferably the docs would scroll at the same time so you can keep the relative position of both (like it does in reader).\n• I'd prefer if the chosen languages stay after you leave the page. Currently it jumps back to English to German as default setting after you leave the page.\n• Status bar doesn't load, just jumps straight to the end.",
