This is because python is not found in the `PATH`.\nPreviously, I saved the `PATH` variable in `.zprofile` . Starting sometime this week, we stopped running `source .zprofile` automatically in new terminals. I have to manually run it.\n\nSee this message for the `PATH` variable\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1737056011693069?thread_ts=1736903131.706169&cid=C05L87V014J",
