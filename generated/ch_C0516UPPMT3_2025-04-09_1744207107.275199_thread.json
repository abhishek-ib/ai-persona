      "message": "I’m not necessarily opposed to this, but I have two concerns.\n\n1. Maintenance: these kinds of lists can fall out of true pretty quickly. I’m happy to take information and updates from Hamish, but it’s one more thing for someone to update and there’s already a lot of moving parts around here. It’s just so easy for the list to become wrong and then, blammo! The docs are wrong.\n2. Isn’t this redundant with the apps page? Something that would be very easy for my (tightly strapped) team would be to add a card from the Docs landing page to the all apps page, just promoting the marketplace. That seems more direct and maintainable to me. Is there any reason a list in the docs is _better_ than a link to the marketplace itself?",
