The plan is to merge its functionalities into Refiner V5. But right now R5 still needs to get its basic set of features working, so merging TR to R5 will probably be a task in the second half of the year. @georgia chestnuts rust-ing on an open fire How can I work with you to set the correct expectation for BAML. I won’t be able to attend the office hour tomorrow, sorry. I think best approach going forward is to get them to use Refiner / Refiner 5 and never touch Table Refiner ever again.\n\nTR’s output is a ibocr, so they can just open that ibocr with sheet. TR currently is not p3 compatible, although I can make a change quickly to support that. Which release is BAML on and what’s the plan to ship a new release to them?\n\nOverall we really need to do a house cleaning of the beta apps. I should take TR down in the next release.",
