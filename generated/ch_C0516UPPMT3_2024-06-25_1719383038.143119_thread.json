I wonder if we can consider making this more generic similar to our planned homepage CTA to \"Create App\"/\"Create Chat\"? I've always felt we have a bit of a dead-end in our Hub where you can't create assets so being able to create an advanced app is awesome. But what if you want to create a different type of asset? cc: @Bastiane @hannah @Kaustubh (KD)",
