These env. params are not present in our env-template.json and has caused an influx of tons of logs to Datadog and GKE logs since 13th December.\nAlso, directly changing a deployment spec in the prod. (and other critical envs.) should be discouraged as not all changes get wiped out in next deployment as `kubectl apply` works like patch.\n\n```        - name: GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT\n          value: \"0\"\n        - name: GRPC_VERBOSITY\n          value: error\n        - name: GRPC_TRACE\n          value: all```\ncc: @abhitaker @puneet",
