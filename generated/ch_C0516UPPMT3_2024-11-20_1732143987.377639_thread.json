      "message": "In accuracy testing, I created a ground truth dataset with v0.0.1 by going through 40 records ensuring accuracy for every field (300+ total fields). I then changed the names of a few fields & deleted a few others in v0.1.0 and tried to run an accuracy test using the same golden from v0.0.1. It asked me to update the dataset to reflect the changed schema so I did, and it reran the app and wiped all the changes I made in the initial run.\n\nI think ground truth datasets should be more \"protected\" since it currently does take a long time to configure the first time, and having to reconfigure it is a big pain. App schema changing in between versions should be a fairly common scenario and we should account for it (e.g. running accuracy metrics only on the classes & fields that are available on the current app version, or asking to create a new version of the ground truth dataset to account for the new schema)",

It's likely the case that I saw \"Outdated\" under the ground truth dataset before running, went to check on the ground truth dataset, thought that I had to update it before running from the popup message, and updated it. I'll take a closer look tomorrow. If it is possible to run on outdated dataset, that's great, I don't think I thought that way initially",
