After that it is 127$ for 25 people.\n\nThe benefits are:\n• Integrates directly with GitHub, you create a PR in GitHub and it shows up in your reviewable dashboard\n• You get a dashboard view of Assigned, Created, Related PRs.  Quite easy to navigate\n• Stores the comments as drafts until you actually publish them (Avoids multiple emails for every reply to a comment)\n• Allows you to specify that a file-revision has been reviewed.  This allows for easier subsequent reviews where one only needs to review what has changed\n\nPlease try to use it for the next few days to see how it works.  I’ll add a reviewable guide to make using this more easy.",
