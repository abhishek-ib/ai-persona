      "message": "Hello Colleagues! A simple-ish question that will have large consequences for my Sol-Eng design for BMO client. Assuming that a job has been successfully submitted via the flow_binary API that then *fails* during the subsequent model or refiner steps (for any reason) ...is it *always* possible to re-run that job ? [assuming the .ibflowbin etc have been updated. Imagine I am trying to ensure that no work is ever lost. So I either have to queue it externally to IB or can rely on IB to never lose work]. @Xi Cheng ?",
