Starting next week (Wednesday), we are going to *strictly* enforce force turndown of all sandboxes every 4 hours.\n\nManagers and Leads, please make sure that this is properly communicated to your teams.  (Policy (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBZkqmCAFtXOaQ_jGx9EyKxwWGliuoHVEcctD1ODfk4/edit))  If you need exceptions for running additional sandboxes, please post it in <#C01N7DV1137|> channel with a reason, and we’ll make sure to address it ASAP.\n\nHere are the sadboxes that I hibernated today:\n• asyncreader\n• lenny8\n• loadtest\n• pdfsvc-solutiontests\n• peter-bundles\n• techinfra\n• us-pre-test\nHere were the sandboxes that were deleted because they were running out of policy:\n• danielgu\n• loadtest-tony\n• testsandbox\n• youngcho-01\ncc @Anant",
