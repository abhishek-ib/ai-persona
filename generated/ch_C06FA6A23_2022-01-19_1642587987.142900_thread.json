Will they also be incorporated eventually and how will that work? Will I get a list of available patches in the UI and can pick the ones to deploy, or will it be all or nothing?  Maybe have all patches available with a flag for each to say if it applies to this customer or not but with the option to add others too (if they have been accidentally excluded for example)\nWhat I want to avoid with customers is having to send new patches back and forth that they have to upload when we detect something is missing.\nWill I also be able to edit each config directly from the UI or do I have to do that directly in file?",

      "message": "Hey Jesper, thanks for the questions!\n1. Currently patched are applied via the control plane APIs, but we are working on a UI for this as well.\n2. For now, we’ll maintain a patch library internally with example patches for the most common configuration options. Then as customers need to make certain changed, such as set up LDAP or SAML, we can send them a patch to do so. Longer term, we want to package some patches into the Control Plane and surface a UI to be able to configure these things similar to how the installer lets you set the database, filesystem, etc. For the time being, we will still have to write and send patches to customers as they need.\n3. We’re also working on a UI in Q1 that allows you to edit the configs / create patches and visualize the diff generated in the configs. For now, the only way to edit configs is to create patches that override whichever values you want to change.\n4. Versioning and tracking is one of the major differences with Control Plane. All configs and patches are versioned and tracked in the Instabase database. This provides us an audit trail of config changes that were made and can also allow us to easily revert / rollback state if ever needed.",
