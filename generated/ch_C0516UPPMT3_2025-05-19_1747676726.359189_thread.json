In this solution, is there a way for us to know what users are asking and not getting responses for?` \n\n`Ie. If the agent does not understand the question based on our documentation, we want to make sure we have the ability to see what is being asked and work towards improving our documents.`\n\n`-Bill`\n\nUse case here is to use operating instructions for Data Center operators. They'd essentially ask the chatbot what the rules/procedures are for XYZ scenario.",
