Instabase reads data from these external sources, processes it in memory, and writes it back to these external storage systems. Instabase does not store any data in its internal systems. Instabase can provide end to end encryption: encryption in transit, client side encryption, and encryption at rest. Please note encryption at rest is managed at the external storage system layer and these storage systems will need to provide this feature. Instabase relies on HTTP to ingest data from the user, and supports various types of file systems [NFS, S3, GlusterFS, Azure Blob Storage, et. al] and databases [MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server].",
