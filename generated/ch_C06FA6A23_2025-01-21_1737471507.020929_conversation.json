This is due to an expired cert in fetching `go-opencensus`, from the source `go.opencensus.io (http://go.opencensus.io)`.\n\nThere have been few fixes attempted today. Some of the earlier ones could not cover everything as this dependency is present through not only our direct usage, but also via other libs, and 3rd party services.\n\nCurrently the last fix being (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C089BRTSVSA/p1737471092822209?thread_ts=1737463335.061219&cid=C089BRTSVSA) tested by the team is aiming to point to github mirror for fetching this lib, and testing that it covers all the builds.\n\nFor the latest, please feel free to check <#C089BRTSVSA|>",
