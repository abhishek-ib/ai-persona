I'm printing a bunch of error level log statements to help me debug something, but I don't see them printed out when I run `make build runlocal` nor do I see them in `worker-image-tasks.log`. I've tried setting pdb and rdb breakpoints as well, but neither seem to stop the flow of execution. Anyone have an idea as to what I might be doing wrong?",
