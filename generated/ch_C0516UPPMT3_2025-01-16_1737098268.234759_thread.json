      "message": "Hey, do we have plans to allow fuzzy matching or LLM based matching in validations? The example given by DBS was that the extracted name was H. Campbell, and in the system of record it could be Hamish Campbell (a match). Would be great if we can coach the LLM on what to accept and not to accept, e.g. not abbreviations but accept middle names.\n\nHappy to make a PFR if this doesn't already exist\n\ncc @Kaustubh (KD)",
