      "message": "@pauline.comising / @Serena, I've been noodling on the concept of AI runtime behavior a bit more... feels like there are two potential ways we could manage this \"major\" version update from Legacy (1.x) --> Advanced (2.x).\n\n1. Keep current behavior but extend update timeframe for \"major\" updates --> e.g. commercial apps could be forced to update in 3 mos, Enterprise in 12 mos.\n2. Make major updates manual only --> this would be a behavior change for AI Runtimes. Apps configured to update automatically would only update automatically in case of minor version upgrades to 1.x stack.\nWe discussed #2 in PRD review but I'm feeling like #1 might actually be cleaner to explain and also means we don't break existing behavior for current apps configured to auto-update. We could always extend the timeline for major upgrades if we get pushback. Thoughts? cc: @Anil / @Abhishek Adupa",
