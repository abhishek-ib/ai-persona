      "message": "During the review stage of ground truth dataset values, the column header row shown in the UI is a little bit confusing.\n\nShown in SS1, the header row (row 1 on the extracted table view on the right of the UI) seems to be a duplicate row. So, I delete row 2 (the perceived duplicate row). SS2 shows deleting the row, and SS3 shows *the confusing behavior:* *The header row is just a second rendering of the actual first row of the table and I'm not sure why* :lil_nervous: \n\nI can see a case for bolding the first row (line 1 indicated in the UI, for example, could be bold), but I know that sometimes there may be no header row where bolding may not make sense. I'm not sure what I'd like to see, but it is a little bit confusing.",
