      "message": ":share: *Sharing of Private Apps is now ready for testing in UAT* :rocket: \nWe need your help to test sharing of private apps, which we are planning to launch with 23.45. To try this feature, go to UAT (aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com (http://aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com)). This feature is highly requested and will help drive viral growth for AI Hub community, and collaboration across teammates for AI Hub commercial. Here are a few things that you can try:\n\n1. Try to use this shared private app I created to process Pokemon Cards (https://aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com/hub/apps/shared/avi.vaid_instabase.com/Pokemon%20cards). (you need to be logged in)\n2. Try to use this invoice processing app shared with an org. (https://aihub-uat.internal.instabase.com/hub/apps/b8f49b0c-1f30-40d5-9a53-dc820a53c576) (only accessible to members of the `aihub-uat` org)\n3. Find shared apps you've recently run, or apps shared with your organisation in the all new app store (click on \"Apps\" in the AI Hub header)\n4. Share apps that you have created with anyone using a link, or with your organisation by clicking the share button on the app page for any app you've created.\nHere's a doc which outlines expected behavior (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzKHk7pa_mV9bK7vDy4uuApFTNX5PT4UUqCp4QWWWnc/edit?usp=drivesdk), and where you can submit your feedback on app sharing. Please also feel free to post in this channel if you encounter any issues. Excited to hear all your thoughts and suggestions, and if you build any fun apps, please share the links to them here for all of us to try out!",
