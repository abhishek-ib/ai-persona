      "message": "Hi team,\nWe have been working on building a marketplace app on aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com). @Anshu and I were discussing a couple of points on how we can improve the user experience for AIHub apps.\n1. *Schema*: For example, if you want to use the passport app, you first open the app from the hub, then click on _App Info_ and finally on _Schema_. While this process only takes a few clicks, can this be improved further for better user experience ?\n2. *Validation*: Currently, there is no easy way to view the validations implemented for a specific app unless you have access to the _Build_ project. It would be helpful to have a section similar to _Schema_ where users can easily see all the validations in place, without needing build access.\ncc : @Nithin @Swathy N",
