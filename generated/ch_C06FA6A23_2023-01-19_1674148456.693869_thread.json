      "message": "Sorry for the late reply!! No, absolutely not. The point of these apply patches is to directly manipulate an environment. Adding the label immediately applies the patches. Patches that require waiting until the next deployment should have the respective “staged” label consumed by Patch TA (which hasn’t been merged yet). Because this change isn’t live yet, we currently depend on these labels for all patch applies from github. The temporary solution is to wait for the deployment of the environment and manually add the apply label afterwards. I’m sorry that this is quite a manual process. Patch TA will be live soon!",

      "message": "@Kerr Yoo Thanks for clarifying. I think we need a formal guidance that brings these nuances together so that users have clear understanding and anticipation about what is going to happen after a patch PR merged. Immediate applying matches to environments such as prod seems very disruptive and error prone so at the moment we need a stringent review on the PRs that add patches to production. For example, if someone makes a change to network policies and that patch goes into prod immediately, we would then have an outage. This had happened to dogfood recently, so we have to be aware of the risks.",

The documentation (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TI/pages/1847918652/Patch+Professor) details these changes that are coming in as well. Regarding patch applying to Prod, I think you bring up a very good point. I’ll think of a way to create more red tape around patch applying to prod, as it’s currently being handled in the same way as with dogfood",
