If you edit the attributes, we re run the whole field in the backend, so the LLM tries to extract from scratch. the LLM is looking for all the requested attributes at the same time, so adding/removing/editing the attributes can impact the overall extraction, not just the attribute which has changed. I will try to experiment with making attributes more isolated. In the mean time, I will recommend adding descriptions to your attributes for best results.",
