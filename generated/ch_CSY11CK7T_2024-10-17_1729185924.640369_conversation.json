      "message": "Hey folks! In frontend guild today, we had a discussion about why our Cypress tests have deteriorated over the past month and how we can get them back to :large_green_circle: . Our conclusion was that the cypress-on-call role needs an expectation reset - one person needs to be responsible for the tests, and since we don't want to put that on one person all the time, it needs to be the on call person. I'm going to incorporate this into the playbook (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YIkXbxu7NE9FD5SQlJs5qj114LD-6yK__-qMA3sWis/edit?tab=t.0) as well, but here's a summary of the changes we propose:\n\n• In general, expect to use a greater portion of your time when you're on call. I've created a calendar with the on call schedule - you can add it to your calendar with this link (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19jMmVkNjZiYTNkYWFiMzllNDRhNDRhNjMxZTc2MmM4MzI3NjFmZmRlNDk0YTVjNGI0ZmRiYjBjOTNjNzBhYmY0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Managers will also add this calendar so that they can see when you're on call and can plan accordingly. When you're on call, any Cypress issues are your priority. cc @andy @Serena @lydia @Heymian - please take this into account!\n• If you see a week you're on call where you will be on vacation or in a different timezone, let me know and I will switch your week.\n• The on-call person is accountable for tests in CI and on aihub-sandbox being green. Some of the issues will be outside of their control (infra issues, tests on parts of the product they're not familiar enough with to fix), but it's their job to do everything they can and be the bad guy, pinging people and following up to get things fixed.\n• Skipping tests to get to green is okay, but it's very important that we keep track of which tests are skipped - this metric is also the on call person's responsibility.\n• At the end of the week, we will have a template for them to send out a summary that includes:\n    ◦ Tests that were broken and fixed in the week\n    ◦ Tests that are skipped (including tagging the test owners)\n    ◦ General issues like sandbox instability, backend bugs, licensing\n• To rotate <!subteam^S07855GV3GV>, use the <#C05AWMD5ER4|> channel.\n• We're going to try to give the on-call person the permission to force merge PRs. Folks will reach out to them if unrelated Cypress tests are failing. The on-call person should evaluate, fix/skip the test, force merge the PR, and track # of PRs forced merged. That way, it's faster to unblock people and easier for the on-call person to know which tests are flaky.\n• For everyone - not just the on-call person - the order of priority for development is: Incidents -> Vulnerabilities -> Bugs -> Cypress tests -> Features\nOur Cypress celebration is at the end of next week. Let's make sure we deserve it! :slightly_smiling_face:",
