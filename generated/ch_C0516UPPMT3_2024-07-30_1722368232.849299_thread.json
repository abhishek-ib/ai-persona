      "message": "Possible prompt leaking?\n\nEnv: `Prod` (24.28)\n\nI was investigating a 24.30 ticket (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1926), and while digging through it, I found a child ticket (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/DR-3772). In that child ticket, there's a POD linked here (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/19faea08-e6e0-4dd0-9172-3879278bac45) supposedly showing an issue where the Stream closes unexpectedly in chatbots. However, looking at the latest utterance and agent response, I feel like there's maybe some prompt leaking occurring. I read that `Advanced` model doesn't work for multi-doc queries anymore (is this true?), but I noticed that the suspicious agent response was a result of the multi-step model.\n\nSee response in screenshot\n\nRaising in case it's a new issue separate from what's logged in the original ticket.",
