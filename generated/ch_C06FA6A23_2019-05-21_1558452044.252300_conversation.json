I’ve heard that in the past we basically run through all our standard demos (Sheet, Refiner, NLP, Diff etc), we can also run through the “Instabase U” training topics, but I don’t know if we have that really formalized. I think that’s a great idea! Very happy to help in creating one after solutions interviews wrap up, since I think it’s actually complementary to what we’ll need to train these engineers on.",
