The main focus for today and tomorrow is to get the CI to pass.\n\nOnce the initial run finishes, I’ll update the canvas (https://instabase.slack.com/docs/T06FA4C8K/F099SC1JSN4) with any failing services/tests.\nPlease add yourself to the service or test you’re working on so we don’t duplicate effort.",
