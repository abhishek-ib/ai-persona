      "message": "Hi, I have some strange behaviour when using clean and validate.\nSteps\n1. I added a clean function to add a leading 0 to company__number\n2. I added a validation function to print out the company__number\n\nI noticed a usability problem:\n• If I add a clean function and without saving, add a validation function, the validation function uses the non-cleaned value. This may be confusing as it shows as cleaned on the platform but the non-clean value is being used. Is there an argument here of an alert that forces users to either save before making new functions or barr it entirely?\n\nAnd a bug:\n• I intended to show the above behaviour, but as i exited both functions, saved, refreshed the page, and entered the validation function, it now cannot find the company__number value `TypeError: unnamed_custom_function() missing 1 required positional argument: 'company__number'` - even though the function has a field called this\n• Making any edit in the function (like adding a new line) seems to unblock this behavior\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/e1cb36e077224e168d453c4f372b79ec?sid=c8456551-12c9-4e75-8c6f-79471f5bdd45",
