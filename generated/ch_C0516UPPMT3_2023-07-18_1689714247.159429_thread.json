      "message": "I ran into a checkbox issue that we could have supported but failed to. I’m hoping it’s an easy change to support the unicode checkbox characters.\n\nThis was with a 10-K digital PDF, so probably a pretty common use case. The document included the unicode checkbox characters (ie: ☐☒☑︎), but I believe we strip out unicode during the doc reader step. So, we couldn’t answer any of the questions. But, if I copy/pasted the lines of text that had the text checkboxes into chatgpt then it was able to make sense of those characters and answer correctly.\n\nAs an example the document had something like:\n☑︎ My name is Josh\n☐ My name is Fred\n\nPaste that text into chatgpt and it can answer the name of the person using the checkbox. But, run a doc through AI Hub using those characters and it can’t answer.",
