It seems that our version of the annotator is a fair bit outdated.  Specifically I am trying to update the anthem.aws.instabase.com (http://anthem.aws.instabase.com) sandbox.  I am not 100% sure who deployed the sandbox originally.  @Shubham Oli - I think you are my best guess.  Can you help out?",
