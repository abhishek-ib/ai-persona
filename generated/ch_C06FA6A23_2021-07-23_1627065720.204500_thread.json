Some languages require installing packages for the same in coderpad. re: python\n2. Are we testing language fluency here or algorithmic design and implementation skills (because a lot of candidates fail because they cannot resolve edge cases in DLL implementation)\nThoughts? suggestions?\nWe can update the doc once a decision is made here.\ncc: @shaunak @Heymian @kunal @achao  @Nidhi @Erick @sudeep @Naveen",
