We encourage you to use UAT to ensure your testing has the latest fixes and changes. We are planning to GA this feature in 24.46.\n\nThe notification feature allows users to configure a webhook or email notification for key events below. The events we support can always be extended over time.\n• Runs start\n• Runs are ready to be reviewed\n• Runs complete\n• Runs fail\nThese notifications are critical for our enterprise integration strategy. @BG @Venkatesh would love to ensure we have testing coverage for this across our RSA and Cass teams (and all others).\n\nSpecial thanks to @Jessica @tony.shi @Natasha @Anil for making this happen. Can't wait to hear the feedback.",
