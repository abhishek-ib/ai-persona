If we can cherry pick into that branch but leave the PR open that would be best, I can make the necessary mypy fixes for it to be merged into master. \n\nCan I send someone who is online rn some api keys that are relevant to this change? Iâ€™ll be asleep when that gets deployed but want to make sure someone has them. When I am awake on SF time I can do some last testing and coordinate with them to make sure all the changes are deployed",
