We have started observing an erratic slowness pattern after I had upgraded third party libraries in dynamic-proxy service. If I downgrade the version, it will bring back security vulnerabilities which will make customers unhappy but with this slowness, it makes notebook unusable at times. I'll think about a solution later in the week.",
