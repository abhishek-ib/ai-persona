Likely one from this Figma Board (https://www.figma.com/file/fnaOWfnrqPqthWp0rBGJll/Pollen-Icons?type=design&node-id=146-11904&mode=design&t=yyvilOm1suB5QReW-0).\n\n@Travis for reference, replacing the icon.png in the `/system/global/fs/...` did not seem to work for me even with the `icon_file` to `icon` change in the package.json. Only an re-upload worked.",
