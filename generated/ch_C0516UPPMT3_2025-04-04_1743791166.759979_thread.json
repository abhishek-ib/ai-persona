Not sure if this feedback has already been given.\n\n• Upon making a query, I'm presented with information. However, it's difficult to assess the validity of the information (the information could be outdated or incomplete). That being said, the sources are linked, but sometimes it's still difficult to discern when the sources were last updated (e.g. gdrive file).\n    ◦ Some suggestions: Would it be possible to filter the sources so that its based on documents updated after x date? Or show on the search UI, in some form show when the information was last updated?",
