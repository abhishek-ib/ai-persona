      "message": "*SaaS Research Series - AXA UK*\n\nThis is the second customer in the SaaS research series (and now GTM is added to these notes). This time we are speaking with AXA UK but the interviewee is Vishnu, who is the CSM on the account. This is because the current team on AXA UK is focusing on solution building & hasn’t gotten hands on the platform yet. There are plans to change this and move AXA UK’s admins into the role, but for now Vishnu has the most experience.\n\n*TL;DR* Secrets management and solution migration are big pain points on SaaS.\n\nWhat does administration involve?\n• Adding/manager users on the platform, and tracking who has logged in\n• Tracking licenses - very helpful to have this feature on ICC itself, Vishnu frequently uses this\n• Secrets management - current process is painful\nDeployed solutions\n• AXA UK solutions have a main flow that calls a child flow\n    ◦ Can publish these solutions as deployed solutions if packaged as an .ibsolution\n• SolEng working on AXA UK team also heard form eng team that solution builder is required for deployed solutions\n    ◦ Deployed solutions does not require solution building - need to revisit this with the SolEng team\n• 6 solutions in development - moving them all over will take time + has friction\nSecrets\n• Valuable to have customers edit themselves, existing process is painful\n• AXA UK wants to rotate tokens every 6mo - rotation should happen via API call\n    ◦ Today secrets can only be set via UI, but API is a good feature request\n• Key rotation led to an outage (due to the customer), but better support for keys would make entire process easier\n• Since new secret management will require updates to solutions, we need documentation on how to update solutions to make updating easier\n• Peter to get feedback on working w/ UDFs from SolEng\nSolution migration\n• AXA UK doesn’t like how we don’t have version control, for development and prod solutions\n    ◦ Developers assume some version control exists\n• Currently trying to integrate Azure DevOps into SDLC Menu feature\nLink to full notes here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbpDQ5_EhQZRSEh9dQYYFVCBQrvDHPTKRrWNjnbHOFs/edit).",
