I couldn’t find any issues tagged with the current release, but have heard that we’re moving towards IBDoc instead of IBOCR everywhere. I’d like to understand the implications for the Diff app, since we presently read IBOCRs there. cc: @shaunak @Jessica (from stalking Github). Is there a resource I can read?",

The `ParsedIBOCR` library will hide everything so as long as you continue to use that library, everything should work appropriately.\n\n@Kerry definitely.  The plan is to test this out for _at least a month_ before rolling it out to consumers.  I’ve been coordinating with Hari to roll out the changes to SC, but would need your help to roll these changes out to our pre-built solutions.",
