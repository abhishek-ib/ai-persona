      "message": "I’d personally prefer that the default behavior is that we load the notebook, but I understand that argument against it. Every notebook environment I’ve used loads up a notebook by default if you click on it. On a related note, for most files on Instabase we open the preview by default, instead of the editor. As a developer on Instabase I think this feature blocks usability. 99% of the time, if I’m opening a file, it’s because I want to edit it.",
