      "message": "Hi Varun, If i can, i'd add to the feedback re the sizing of Converse and Build. I agree with Lee, currently they look bigger and out of sync with the rest. Although *you* know they are like that on purpose to stand out, that might not be obvious to other users, who then may just think it looks messy. Could you consider highlighting them in another way... Either with a border or shadow or having them in a section of their own \"featured Apps\".\nI would consider changing the way you want to highlight them so its more obvious to users, rather than looking like the sizing is off.\nHope that helps.",
