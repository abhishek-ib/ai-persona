      "message": ":wave:  for some context, this was added to help clean up our code base when we were trying to onboard python to bazel (which unfortunately has been paused for a long time). Cycles arise from circular imports, which were all over our code base before â€” they are strongly discouraged in python, and flat out unsupported in bazel, but they can arise from hacky import patterns (good rule of thumb for avoiding this is to always import modules at the top of your python files and nowhere else)\n\nYou can certainly tweak the output to be more helpful if you have ideas for improvement, just tag the platform team as a reviewer on PRs :)",
