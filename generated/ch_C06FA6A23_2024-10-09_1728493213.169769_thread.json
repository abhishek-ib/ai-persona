The home page (https://frag-connector.internal.instabase.com/) is loading properly. However, when I try to access deployment manager, it asks me to go through the install process (https://frag-connector.internal.instabase.com/deployment-manager/installer). Does anyone know how could I fix this?",

Argo cd / argo cd sandbox related questions should go in <#C058UFAGWTF|>, which I monitor more frequently.\n\nHaving the install process appear in DM typically means that one of DM’s environment variables in incorrectly configured. I imagine that when the sandbox was created/updated, the sync must have failed, causing the configuration to be incorrect. A resync with argo, as you performed, would fix the problem.\n\nCurrently, we set the ICC state to running if a sync can be started, which is incorrect behavior — the state should be set after the sync succeeds or fails. I’m working on a PR that achieve this right now.",
