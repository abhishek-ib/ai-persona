      "message": "Hey Team, providing feedback on Human View UI. We’ve encountered several usability issues in the Human Review dashboard that make the review process confusing. Here’s a summary of the feedback:\n\n*1. Inaccurate/Misleading Document Count in Dashboard Panel*\nThe top panel currently shows *230 documents*, which is misleading.\n In this case, I uploaded *32 files*, and after splitting, there are *81 documents (t*his is only shown as small text to the right of the search bar that is easy to miss*)*. The dashboard count appears to include documents from other runs, not just the current one.\n*Suggestion:* The dashboard should reflect the *actual number of documents associated with the selected run only* to avoid confusion and allow accurate tracking of review progress.\n\n*2. Run Context Not Persisted Across Tabs*\nWhen I click on *\"Not Started\"*, *\"In Review\"*, or *\"Completed\"*, I have to *manually re-enter the runId in the search bar* every time. This breaks the flow and adds unnecessary repetition.\n*Suggestion:* The UI should *retain the selected runId context* across tab switches, so users don’t need to re-filter repeatedly.\n\n*3. Improved Dashboard Summary for Human Review*\nCurrently, it’s hard to get a clear overview of the Human Review status.\n *Suggestion:* The dashboard should clearly show the following:\n• Total files uploaded\n• Total documents after splitting\n• Count of documents in each status: Not Started, In Review, Completed\nThis would make it easier to verify progress and communicate with stakeholders (like clients) about the status.\n\n\nLinked issue: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1749238510040609?thread_ts=1749181037.697909&cid=C05BJCNKZAM",

      "message": "Thanks for sharing @shreya.rajput! Totally agree with all of these points.\n\nI think many of these issues will actually be addressed as part of Case management milestone 3 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1860), where we need to revamp much of this dashboard to support the new concept of _Packets_. Part of this revamp includes 'flattening' the review table to be a single list of tasks, which could be either Files, Runs, or Packets, depending on the Deployment settings & app configuration. This will replace the confusing file vs. document stats with a simple Task count, remove the tabs so there's no loss of runId to worry about, and should simplify the summary. This deck (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lu-KpsQOZYAg3cIKcz9KNKHQRNDRXG49VueZltvoLQo/edit?slide=id.g31e15c51d7c_0_449#slide=id.g31e15c51d7c_0_449) is a little old at this point but also covers some of the other problems we're hoping to fix with human review, would love any additional input!",
