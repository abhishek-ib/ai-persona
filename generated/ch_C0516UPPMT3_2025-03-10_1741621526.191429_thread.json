      "message": "Hi team, sharing some feedback received from the UOB trade finance team on a Converse solution they have been trying to build. They were trying to provide instructions on a long task as a document and have the MS model carry out the tasks using the attached case docs. (FYI As a next step I'm going to try and encode the \"instructions\" as a Build project that completes each step 1 by 1)\n• Abrupt ending of the program (see screenshots)\n• Results are not consistent for the same prompt and same documents attached. (sometimes the result was pretty good, other times not)\n• Unable to get the OCR confidence percentage as part of the results. (in Converse)\n• Format for the results - System is not following the expected format given in the instructions. Do you suggest any better representation? (I think this is overloading the prompt so will be why this is missed)\n• Is the system capable of taking feedback on its own /auto training capabilities, based on the corrections/input back from the user for the previous cases? (sounds a bit like this: https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3773 @BG)",
