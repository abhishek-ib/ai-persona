      "message": "Quick Cypress status:\n• upstream-integrations is failing because of our outlook mailbox subscription expired, working on getting this fixed\n• advanced-apps was failing because a component was remounting, I have a fix coming for this (but there's another bug, see below that will also prevent it from succeeding)\n• @Victor Zeng payment is failing (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/16797/overview/dcea53e7-7f1e-4501-b98c-da46303100bd/replay?att=1&roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1) for migrated user test with the error `Error: no auth mechanism defined`\n• Several extraction tests are failing with extraction errors: `\"msg\": \"Error during refiner extraction: model result is empty due to an error in model service\\n\\n METADATA:\\n\\n\\n{\\\"extraction_result\\\": null}\"`. Backend issue maybe? @Serena @danny.lan. Affected tests are aihub-custom-function-field, aihub-data-types, aihub-derived-field, aihub-extraction, aihub-quick-clean-refinement, aihub-redigitization, aihub-refinement, aihub-split-by-page, aihub-split-classification, build-billing (so like all the build ones)\n• I see one for aihub-templates that failed on the first try then didn't clean up correctly so failed on the next two tries - I'll look into fixing that @Serena \n• Digitization is failing in converse-app, I believe it's the same issue as for build (it says \"failed to create index\")\n• Looking into a new downstream-integrations failure for custom functions\n• search-app is failing but it looks like it's been failing for a really long time. @Subash do you want to just skip this test if it's not in use?\n• run-app, run-public-app, review-manager-dashboard, review-reviewer-dashboard are failing because the actual runs are failing - I'm wondering if this is related to the build errors but I can look into this a little deeper to double check @Serena \n• documents-grid, advanced-apps, field-editor, file-list, nested-field-editor, and results-table are all failing because files aren't uploading to be able to run them, probably the same indexing error",
