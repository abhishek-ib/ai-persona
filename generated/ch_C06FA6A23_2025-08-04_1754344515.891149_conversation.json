      "message": "Heads up! We’re rolling out some key infrastructure upgrades over the coming weeks:\n• *Karpenter* will replace *cluster-autoscaler* as our EKS node autoscaler.\n• *Bottlerocket* will replace *Amazon Linux 2 (AL2)* as our node AMI.\n• *EBS Snapshots* including our latest certification images will now be attached to each cluster node on startup.\nTogether, these changes will help make *AIHub* and *IB Platform* more elastic under load, faster to deploy, and more cost-efficient. Today, these changes *are live in our release sandboxes*.\n\nWe’ll keep you posted as we measure the impact (expect some nice % improvements!), but since these changes affect our base compute layer, we wanted to give everyone a quick signal boost. Ideally, the only downstream noticeable effects will be of the _\"Huh, that deployment or job felt faster than usual!\"_ nature. :smile::rocket:\n\nThanks, and more updates soon!\ncc @Abhinav @Ashwin @Ashish",
