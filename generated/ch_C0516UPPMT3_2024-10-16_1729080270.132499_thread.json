This is definitely something our customers should not experience if we can help it.\n\nThe second issue as @Serena mentioned is on our backlog, we haven't heard too much noise around it but we can consider this if we get more feedback (candidly its not prioritized for Q4 yet)",

If I copy-paste the same cleaning code across 100+ different fields from 5+ different classes, then I can imagine all those extra \"unique\" functions could add up to making the project files unnecessarily large and clunky. I've seen mention of things like validation functions freezing and crashing the front end UI, so this feels like a plausible threat.",
