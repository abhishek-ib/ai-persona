When you select a text/PDF/image file, you’ll see a preview of the file on the right-hand side of the screen. This will be included in the upcoming code cut for prod. Please let us know in <#CLBGA5A7K|> if you notice any bugs or usability issues!",

Docs workflow relies on Jira issues on the release board, like https://instabase.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=104&projectKey=CDEP&quickFilter=275\nSee, if we have a Jira issue, then we could provide release notes in that issue to show up in a filter like this https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10137\n@John Hung did we want to provide release notes and docs for the November features? This quick view is going to be the next best thing to sliced bread (I have always wanted this feature).",
