(https://github.com/instabase/instabase/actions/runs/12758722549?pr=66948) \n2. for testing an old app, previous instructions might not apply to the new crafting template that has its own db: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05EQQJGN7L/p1720634449299679?thread_ts=1720630631.397669&cid=C05EQQJGN7L How can I test this with an empty db? will try to switch into Dogfood as a first step.",
