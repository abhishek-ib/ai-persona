Even if you happen to get it to load during the migration window, don't expect it to stay online until I've announced the migration is complete. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI'll be running a thread in <#C035SLYCJ9X|> to share the high-level status updates as they come along, and will keep a running commentary there if anything goes sideways.\n\nWhen the migration is done, I'll make an announcement there and will also broadcast it loudly here in this channel as well. After that announcement, my expectation is that PreProd Jenkins should be stable and ready for regular use!\n\nAs always, let us know in <#C035SLYCJ9X|> if anything doesn't function properly after the migration. If any breakage is full blocker and requires immediate action, please page *me* via OpsGenie.\n\nThanks!",
