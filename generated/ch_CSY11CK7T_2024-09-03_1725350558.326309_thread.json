For frontend (/js) packages I am looking into this (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/webserver/shared/src/js/webpacked/package.json) package.json file for the dependencies. This package.json references to following  instabase’s own npm packages:\n• @instabase.com/api\n• @instabase.com/app-os-kit\n• @instabase.com/pollen\n• @instabase.com/doc-widget\nCan someone point me to package.json’s for each of these. And also if we have js dependencies in any other package.json files, can someone point me to those.\ncc @sudeep\n\nThanks!",
