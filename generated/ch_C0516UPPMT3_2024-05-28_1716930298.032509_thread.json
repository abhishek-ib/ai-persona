      "message": "For some fields provenance is not working well yet. I understand why this happens when it's not clear where exactly an extracted value originated from but a lot of times it is very clear and even a regex would find the source location of the value. On the screenshot you can see one example where the extracted value is written exactly the same in the document as it was extracted - but it is not provenance tracked. This happens for all types for documents single page or document package.\n\nIs this something being worked on our is it worth an additional PFR ticket?",
