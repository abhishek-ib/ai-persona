Candidly haven't tried this much.\n• Supports upload from GDrive, website, and youtube! \n    ◦ I'm guessing Youtube is not multimodal but just the transcript.\n• Only supports 50 docs relative to our 100. Doesn't have any digitization settings. \n    ◦ Does not support JPG/image formats. Does not support excel.\n    ◦ Does decently on handwritten text for single doc. Haven't really pushed to try multidoc.\n• Does fairly well with multidoc queries. \n• Provides citation level provenance - better than our page level provenance\n• Allows saving \"insights\" generated by model as notes to refer back to. Particularly interesting for collaboration scenarios. \ncc: @Hari @Balaram @Clemens FYI",
