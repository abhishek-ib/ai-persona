      "message": "This was just an idea I was tinkering with. I was curious how well AI Hub could complete a task for a specific document while also referencing other external documents. It'd be pretty neat to give the users more control of the chatbot interface like labeling classes of documents (i.e. these are the claims, this is the input claim etc.) that can be referenced in the prompts. Kind of like a workbench to complete a task that other users could leverage and upload the docs specific to their task.\n\nThe multi-step reasoning is impressive. I was shocked with minimal prompt editing how it was able to understand the claim context, find the right policy / policy section and for the most part map the policy requirements to the claim evidence.",
