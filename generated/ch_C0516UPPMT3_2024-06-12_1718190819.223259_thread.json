      "message": "Hey team, for deployed apps, if there are documents waiting to be reviewed - what happens after they are reviewed?\n\n1. Do we have a web-hook that will notify once the review has been completed? \n2. Or will the results just not appear if you try to pull them down until this checkpoint has been passed?\n3. In the UI, it looks like after review, the App run status changes to 'Completed', but if I click on the run there is no reviewed tick next to the file name like you usually get\n4. There's also nothing to stop further changes being made to the results. If changes get made after review is complete, do we keep tracking what changes and who has made them? Do we want to allow further changes? (If'm thinking if after reviewed results get pushed downstream, someone could come in to the UI and think they are correcting a mistake but those new changes don't get pushed downstream to update the already pushed results for example)",

Once documents are reviewed, they will be completed and passed to to downstream integration.\n\nWhen documents are completed, they also will not automatically show up in user's documents to review table unless they filter to see completed ones.",

      "message": "I had a quick play around and in general this is a BIG step in the right direction :blob-clap: Some things I noticed:\n• I found it a bit jarring that we now have both apps and deployments, both of which I can push documents through and review results. Since theres not really any visual differences between the two I got quite muddled and I'm sure customers would here\n• I feel like deploy would benefit from being a bit more visual. For example, icons like we have in Hub, and then clicking on a deployment shows you an illustration of the app with downstream/upstream integrations shown visually on either side maybe with automation/accuracy values. This comes from, at the minute, I found when I had made a deployment it was quite opaque to understanding what I had added on top of the core app (with many people working in the org this will be compacted)\n• On document based review (other than the points above), I found it confusing that there was a 'Mark as reviewed' button as well as a 'Submit and next' button. Do i have to click both or does one overwrite the other? \n• General point: I find it unclear when a field can be left as an \"error\" field. For example, sometimes a blank entry or N/A answer might be correct, and its unclear to me whether when I mark as reviewed these are problematic as from my memory the red border for these fields doesn't get removed on clicking complete",
