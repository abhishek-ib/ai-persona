      "message": "Hi everyone, I wanted to announce a new improvement to sandboxes on Sandbox Console: you can now *reuse pre-built images for individual services* instead of rebuilding everything from scratch when using a custom branch. Basically, *you only need to rebuild the services that you’ve modified*. This makes deployments faster, more efficient, and easier on our build infra for both sandbox creation and updates. :rocket:\n\nWhen deploying a sandbox using a custom branch, you’ll now see a list of services with available pre-built images (fetched from the most recent aihub-sandbox or aihub-uat deploy depending on your base branch). From here you can choose which services will use pre-built images - all other services will still be built as normal.\n\nNote that this feature is only compatible with Argo CD sandboxes. DM sandboxes will still require all services to be rebuilt.",
