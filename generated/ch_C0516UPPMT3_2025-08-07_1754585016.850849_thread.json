      "message": "Hey team, flagging a blocker from Northwestern Mutual around app versioning that’s starting to impact adoption.\n\n*Issue:*\n Only app owners can version apps. For teams working collaboratively, this means anyone else needs to duplicate or recreate the app to make changes - defeating the purpose of versioning.\n\n*Impact:*\n• Breaks collaboration in shared projects\n• Creates confusion around ownership and lineage\n• Undermines confidence in versioning as a governance tool\n• Becoming a blocker to rollout across teams. If the owner is on PTO or leaves the company, they're forced to create a new app.\n*EPD-1974 (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1974)*\n @jack.robbins I know this is on the Q3 roadmap, but the customer is asking for a confident ETA and a viable workaround in the meantime. Is the Q3 timeline firm? And are there any interim options we can offer (beta access, ownership transfer, etc.)?\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Unfortunately, the Q3 timeline for this isn’t firm. We need all hands on deck -especially from the backend team - to finish Case Management and unblock other critical work related to Data Types. A lot of that planning came together in the past few weeks, so apologies for the confusion around the roadmap tag, we really did hope this could fit.\n\nI’ll check with @Serena next week to see if there’s anyone else on the engineering side who could potentially pick this up. It’s low-level work and likely requires a senior engineer, so options may be limited.\n\nIn the near term, the most realistic workaround is to collaborate on the existing project (multiple users can still edit the underlying project), and create a new app if the original author is unavailable and a new version is needed. They could also create a shared login & an account specifically for publishing versions, but honestly that may be more work than created a new app when needed.\n\nIt’s definitely painful when the app owner is OOO or leaves the company, and I agree it undermines the purpose of versioning. I’ve captured this example of customer impact in this doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhPdiyuNFFb4bjVLCwu85JI5NMasNw0Nuo30herrMS4/edit?tab=t.0) (along with many others...), and we’re aligned that this is something we _absolutely_ plan to improve when we have more bandwidth.\n\nHappy to discuss live if needed too.",
