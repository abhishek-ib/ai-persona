      "message": "Is there a way to restrict within split classify to 1 document of each type in a submission and then auto push the rest to \"Other\"? For example, if we need to classify 20+ across a packet -> can we inform the LLM that there is only 1 \"loan app\" versus 1 \"insurance app\" -> currently a lot gets classified in the wrong bucket. If we were able to restrict the 1, we could classify the significant docs and push the rest to other while we work on the optimization activities",
