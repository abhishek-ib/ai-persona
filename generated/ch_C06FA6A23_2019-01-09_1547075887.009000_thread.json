      "message": "Gotcha. Here’s the post Paul that you were trying to get access to. If you could port that into the Docs that’d be great:\n\n\napi-server runlocal now runs on Python 3\n\nWhat does this mean for your local env?\n1. Create a new virtual environment, located in a different directory than your Python 2 venv\n\n2. python3 -m pip install -r tools/devtools/code-dependencies/python/requirements_py3.txt\n\n3. Use this Py 3 virtualenv when running api-server locally\n\nIf you ever need to go back to the Python 2 version of api-server, use:\nmake build runlocal-py2\n\nAs far as other servers go, I will discuss a migration plan in another post.\n\nI’ve been writing a simple doc for Python 2 to Python 3 compatible replacements:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YxMHM6KoPgLDaUUUKtaC3ju5bxF8aXeGMVmXQK7INSc/edit#\n\nIn the near future, we will need to make sure we write fully compatible Py2 and Py3 code!",
