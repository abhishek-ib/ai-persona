      "message": "hi, two questions\n1. Do we have an automatic garbage collection service that deletes old uploads?\n2. (If not) Currently, customers go through a 3 step process to run files into compiled apps; Upload file to specified folder > Run Solution > Get Solution Results. We have got queries around completing the process with a 4th step i.e; deleting the uploaded files stored in Instabase. How are we able to support this?\nThere doesnt seem to be a delete file/folder API as part of the Postman collection, so im curious how we should respond to these cc @fernando.piazza.ctr",
