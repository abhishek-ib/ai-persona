      "message": "I’ll just tack onto this that the Docsbot itself does answer the question:\n\n> When creating automation apps, the following field types are available:\n> \n> 1. **Derived Field**: This field type allows you to generate values based on preceding fields in the class. For example, you can identify the state in a customer address.\n> \n> 2. **List Extraction Fields**: These fields allow for the extraction of multiple attributes. The number of allowed attributes has been increased from 10 to 30, although accuracy may degrade with more than 10 attributes.\n> \n> 3. **Document Reasoning Fields**: These fields include an “Enhance prompt” option that optimizes your prompt for clarity, concision, and coherence while eliminating contradictions and redundancies.\n> \n> 4. **Custom Function Field**: This field type lets you compute values or import third-party data directly into your project schema.\n> \n> These field types are designed to enhance the flexibility and functionality of automation apps by allowing for complex data extraction and processing.",
