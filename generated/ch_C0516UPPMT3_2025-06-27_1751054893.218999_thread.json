      "message": "Hey team, @daniel.high and I just came out of a discovery call with the VP of disruptive technologies at Prudential Financial who owns their IDP, Chatbots, and Process Automation and wanted to share some insights:\n1. They currently use a mix of Captiva OpenText, UIPath IXP, and custom built AWS Textract solutions\n    a. Captiva is used for more structured, low complexity, happy path use cases\n    b. UIPath IXP (Demos here (https://youtu.be/s2GhgMEE_i4) and here (https://youtu.be/5xCefm_1m5k)) is their new GenAI based platform doing extraction similar to how AIHub does it. They use this to power use cases that aren't possible with Captiva. He said they can \"easily\" get up to 95% accuracy with this tool, and it integrates well with their other RPA based processes within UIPath. IXP also offers the ability to extract using both LLM and ML and compare the results to pick the best one.\n        i. One interesting bit he mentioned was that they do LESS human review now than they used to - they run the extraction, then send it downstream to kick off bots to do more rule based checks. Didn't get to dig much deeper here but they've been testing this approach for a few months now\n2. He was interested in the document based chatbot capabilities - need to do more discovery here, but it sounded like the use case would be to verify newly extracted information against a large corpus of previously referenced documents\n@kyle.riordan @aristo When you were putting together this battlecard (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DvFw6Edzg4Hb1psd2yBtc8Ge8cMbVrJmYsJhub4ys1Y/edit?slide=id.g35fbf1c76bb_0_296#slide=id.g35fbf1c76bb_0_296), were there specific types of unstructured docs that are complex and long that we were better at than UIPath? He also mentioned that OCR is not a big issue because they use other partner OCR engines anyway",

      "message": "Got it thanks, its possible with IXP that they have closed the unstructured gap significantly. My understanding is that it is still preview but they have been rolling it out to  customers. The docs state that it is optimized for specific data (https://docs.uipath.com/ixp/automation-cloud/latest/overview/introduction) types so I wonder if that figure indicative of something in that subset or representative of performance overall.",
