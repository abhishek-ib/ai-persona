      "message": "I do agree this doesn't make too much sense for converse because the data isn't updated in the background. It isn't the best UX to wait for a loading spinner for a while after you switch back to a tab - this also resets the state sometimes.\ncc @Jessica what do you think about not having the global refetching for window refocus. I personally too have not been a fan of this behaviour - I use a multiple tabs a lot and getting a spinner before I can do anything isn't great. Also I think reloading to get fresh data is familiar by most users.\nWe can probably increase the stale time to begin with, I think the current stale time is 5 mins.",
