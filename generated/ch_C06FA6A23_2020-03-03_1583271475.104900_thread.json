All base images/services have been upgraded, as well as the Jenkins/Travis image. \n\nEveryone will need to update Thrift in order to build our code. Good news though, now that we have the latest and greatest, freshly pushed thrift version as of last week, we can install directly from brew without needing to pull some ancient version via macports!\n\nHow to uninstall thrift 0.10.0\n* If you installed thrift via macports, you can do:\n    $ cd <path-to-macports>/devel/thrift\n    $ sudo port uninstall thrift\n* If you installed thrift via brew, you can do:\n    $ brew uninstall thrift\n\nHow to install thrift 0.13.0:\n    $ brew install thrift\n\nVerify it installed:\n    $ thrift --version\n    > Thrift version 0.13.0\n\nThat should be it! You might need to rebase your outstanding PRs on master in order to get your tests to pass. Setup docs have also been updated. Hopefully the upgrade goes smoothly for everyone! ```",
