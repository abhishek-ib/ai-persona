Do we have a plan to consolidate this @melissa.amos?\n• Since the only two runtime config settings are for post-processed docs and webhooks, can we instead just pull out these two snippets and put them on the main run page? cc: @Chris Cowell @Rakesh \n• Should customers still be using notifications through the api vs. setting at the deployment? cc: @Jessica If they shouldn't can be remove these references into a legacy spot?",

      "message": "@hannah ++ for the valuable usability feedback -- thanks for letting us know.\n\nFor each bullet point:\n\n* Yeah, that’s not easy to discover. I’ll add a sentence in the intro paragraph for the Run API operation, at the top of the page. It will link to the hard-to-find wording you found lower down on the page.\nHaving the phrase “runtime configs” to refer to two different things definitely sounds confusing. Changing one of the names sounds like a product/design call, which will need to be implemented by dev. Then I can update the docs if they need it.\n\n* The “runtime configs” described on https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference/run-reference seem to be used for two purposes: setting runtime variables that are used in validation functions, and enabling the “generate_post_process_pdf” feature. I’m not sure which API operations involve the first. Only the Run App and Run Deployment API operations involve the second. I don’t know if @Anil has plans to make either runtime variables or the generate_post_process_pdf feature relevant for any other API operations in the future.\n\n* The explanation of how and why to use runtime configs on https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference/run-reference feels too long and too general in scope to belong on the docs pages for the Run App and Run Deployment API operations, so I’d advise leaving the current wording where it is.\n\nThe webhooks are a separate configuration option, which for now are only used by Run App and Run Deployment API operations. The existing explanations for webhooks also feel too big to go on the main page for those two operations, so I’d leave them on https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference/run-reference.\n\nSince both runtime configs and webhooks are important configuration options, I think it makes sense to add pointers at the top of the docs pages for the Run App and Run Deployment API operations, to let readers know that they should click over to https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference to learn more about configuring their app or deployment runs.\n\n* I’m not sure I understand the question in the last bullet?\n\n@hannah Does that all sound reasonable?",
