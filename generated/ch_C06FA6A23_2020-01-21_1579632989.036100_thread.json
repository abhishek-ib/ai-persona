It fails to open a refiner program located at: https://dogfood.instabase.com/apps/refiner-v3/ib_eng/tests/fs/Test%20Drive/tests/acceptance-testing/udf_imports/prog/refiner.ibprog, despite being able to view the fs tree under `ib_eng`. If I try to download that file as chetan's test account, it fails with \"Cannot open a non-existent file in r mode\". The file exists and has contents when opened as my instabase user account. Anyone know what might be going on?",
