      "message": "Hey y’all, I have a PR that disables webpack’s websocket server so that the Cypress CI runs no longer crash (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1729604267091089) (hopefully). It seems to be working with failed runs successfully printing out the Cypress URL (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/64174#issuecomment-2430333217) and the CI runs are failing in an expected manner (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/actions/runs/11468091350/job/31912807818).\n\nI don’t think we use webpack’s websocket when doing dev work? Please let me know if this PR will break anything:\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/64174",
