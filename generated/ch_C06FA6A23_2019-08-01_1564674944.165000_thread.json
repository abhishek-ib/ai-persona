Just got a ticket asking if FRB can install a python library into their instance: https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/409 I know previously some customers were installing things on our docker images after we handed them over (New Relic agent, I believe?). Is this similar? Or do we want to do it for them? Or…?",
