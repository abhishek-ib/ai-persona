      "message": "hi team, is anyone familiar with ibocr methods? I'm trying to create an `IBOCRRecord` that is the same as another `IBOCRRecord` , but with different refined phrases by doing\n```builder = IBOCRRecordBuilder()\nbuilder.set_from_deepcopy_of_record(original_ibocr_record)\nbuilder.set_refined_phrases(my_new_refined_phrasese)\nnew_ibocr_record, err = builder.as_record()```\nHowever, I can't figure out how to do this - it seems like I can never change ibocr metadata that is set by the `set_from_deepcopy_of_record` , no matter what code I write to clear/change the refined phrases before/after I do `set_from_deepcopy_of_record` . Does anyone know if its possible to do what I want to do?",
