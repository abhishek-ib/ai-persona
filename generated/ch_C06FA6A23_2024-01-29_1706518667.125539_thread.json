      "message": "If I'm reading that right, it sounds like they want to run tests frequently on prod in order to ensure that all their services are running properly, as a sort of monitoring framework.  They don't seem to care that IB is actually OCRing, classifying, or extracting, but rather that their connections function as expected.\n\nIf I am understanding correctly, then what if we:\n• set up a dummy flow that they can call with a special test flag, where it just takes in the mock file (perhaps checking it via a UDF to ensure it matches the expected test file), \n• then outputs a hard coded output file that represents what a prod flow would output for that input file.  \nIn this case, since the test flow would encompass only UDFs and no OCR or model steps, would running this necessarily count towards their page count?",
