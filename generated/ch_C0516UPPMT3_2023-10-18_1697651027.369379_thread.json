      "message": "@joshbronko is your ask to run Refiner fields in parallel instead of sequentially? That is a pretty big lift because right now, we don't parse out the dependency graph of fields from left to right, so we don't know which fields can be run in parallel vs. sequentially. Also, we would need to load test to see if this affects Flow run times since they batch at the file level, not field level.\n\nCan you describe more the problems you're running into? What speed issues are you experiencing?",
