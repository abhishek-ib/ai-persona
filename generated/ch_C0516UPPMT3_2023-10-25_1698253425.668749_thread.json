      "message": "A few thoughts while using Build:\n• An icon (or label) for which Model is being used for fields in Build would be helpful. \n• A multi-select ability to change many fields models all at once\n• The dropdown for changing the model type isn’t very obvious, having a label on it would be helpful\n• Also when creating a lot of fields at once having a “model” select option in that popup would be useful\n• The upload progress tab at the bottom is kind of strange, can’t the files just show up in the file list and have an “uploading/loading” indicator\n• Editing a field, running it, having to click “Save” at the bottom, _then_ having to click the breadcrumb “Classes” at the top to show all fields is a lot of clicking. And when doing this for many fields is not ideal.\n    ◦ Move the “Save Fields” button (and even the run field button) to the top of the column\n    ◦ Make a “Show all Fields” button or something, the breadcrumbs isn’t very clear\n• Hotkeys would be pretty sweet",
