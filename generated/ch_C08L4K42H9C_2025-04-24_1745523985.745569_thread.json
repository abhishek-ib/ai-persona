This came up earlier today during a research session focused on deployments and how Instabase fits into the broader customer workflow—beyond upstream and downstream integrations.\n\nCheck out the clip from *23:35 to 23:51* in the recording below, and feel free to watch more if you have time.\n\n> “Well, it's pretty great, because it's very user-friendly and I'm not having any problem developing apps on Instabase.”\nRecording link: https://instabase.zoom.us/rec/share/tquNShC5GPJEVzS0muyH2ApTnQO9lhYdU4bIMxSRp9kz_0G6WCJOlGfjN1mmlek.0SDiD3B6lnvLhwHt\nPW: .MfOQ@6U",
