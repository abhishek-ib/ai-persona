He mostly referenced infra/backend stuff, but as we all know, there's a lot that can be done for our frontend build as well to simplify and modernize.\n\nFor Thursday's frontend guild, I want to spend the majority of the time brainstorming what we could do to speed up development, make debugging and deploying easier, and even make the end experience for users better. Please give this a little thought beforehand and come ready to brainstorm. For next week's guild, I'm going to move it to a time that works for @Kerry and we can discuss these ideas with her.",
