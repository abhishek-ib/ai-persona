Should we consider upgrading our Cypress plan?\n\nthis isn’t super urgent since they’ll charge us for the additional usage if we exceed our plan’s allotted capacity, but maybe it’ll be cheaper in the long run if we upgrade our plan?\n\n@Dave @Jessica I think you briefly looked into this at one point?",
