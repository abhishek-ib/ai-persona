Is it by bazel module?\n\nHow are the dependencies built to run the (I assume?) unit tests? Is it still using the Jenkins CI docker image? or building a new pyenv for each module based on the dependencies listed in Bazel?",

      "message": "yeah the doc is still being worked on and should be available next week, short answer is that this mostly is a workflow/infra change with minimum code change, so essentially it is just a break down on the existing CI runs to add more parallelization, at the same time to take advantages from a few features provided by github action, and the breakdown is simply by the directory and number of components (one build job per sub directory up to 25 components)\nunder the hood it is running the exact same make target as jenkins CI after we split the jobs and have more granular control, at the same time easy for us to evaluate and compare with jenkins CI during the beta period, moving forward we will make changes accordingly based on our bazel project progress.",
