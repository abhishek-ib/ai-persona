      "message": "@Travis, in this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/60627) I changed the use of `DataEditor` to `Spreadsheet`, which I noted is essentially just a pollen wrapper for `DataEditor`. This change was also necessary since we have some custom additional logic for rendering such a component inside a modal (can read this (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1722460700502479) thread). I noticed that in this PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/60699/files) we reverted the use back to `DataEditor` — I just wanted to clarify why this change was necessary. It’s unfortunately breaking our use case for solution accuracy so want to understand if/where the divergence between `DataEditor` and `Spreadsheet` is",
