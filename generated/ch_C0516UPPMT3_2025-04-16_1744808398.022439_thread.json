      "message": "This is another instance of relevant chunks not surfacing during weaviate queries. After switching to the latest embedding model, I can see that the retrieved chunks are far better. Top 5 chunks contain relevant information and top-10 contains all the data needed to answer the query. More number of chunks from AI Hub documentation is also getting picked up in the top-5.\n\nSo switching to the latest embedding will fix this problem to an extent. We have already started working on it! Adding a reranking of the retrieved chunks should provide further improvement.\n\nAdded this query to our Weaviate Dense Queries Analysis sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZCKyKUAdYaplMtYC0DgX23N0xjNLToStAuwXI8NdFS8/edit?usp=sharing). Thanks @Rosie for flagging this issue!",
