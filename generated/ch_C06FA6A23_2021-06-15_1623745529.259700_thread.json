V1.1 is on its way, I’ve  added a standalone encrypt_ib_file.py for the case users need to encrypt files from AWS S3 to transfer back to IB. I’ve tidied up the code so that its core library can be easily packaged as a dev ex toolkit(I’m thinking about ib_easy_cryptography as a name). I’ll demonstrate this during a knowledge sharing session next week that Saikat asked me to do.",
