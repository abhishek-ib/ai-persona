When I copy one of his folders to anywhere in my workspace, I get a nested folder - so copying `my folder 1/my file.txt` would get me `my folder 1/my folder 1/my file.txt`. I've attached the HAR for one of the copy requests just in case I'm sending something incorrectly. When I try it within my own workspace I don't get the same behavior.",
