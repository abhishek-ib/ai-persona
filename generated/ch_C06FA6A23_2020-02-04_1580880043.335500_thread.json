      "message": "I have a larger existential question, do we need to think about when we now use Abby vs Microsoft OCR for solutions? Has this been thought of from a engineering strategy? I plan to get a larger deal in place to make sure we have Microsoft as a definitive solution (at the very least trying to get an obligation that we will always have access to the last build they gave us but maybe not future builds, this is still in the works). We have 0 things in place to make sure we have Microsoft OCR as a guarantee so curious how you are all thinking about it.",
