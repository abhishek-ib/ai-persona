      "message": "My overall comment is that, it seems we turned on the merge blocking too early. I understand that we see improvements after we turn it on, but i'm still wondering if we can achieve these with ways other than merge blocking. For example, setting aside time for people to fix the concurrency, make their tests less flaky, keeping eye on the sandbox Cypress test run result. We identified these issues before we turn on merge blocking but didn't address them.\nQ for our current state, with this 70% failure rate, should we turn off merge blocking until the failure rate drops? Since people are not complaining about Jenkins CI, maybe the Cypress CI failure rate needs to go down near the Jenkins CI failure rate (34%)? Maybe we can answer this after switch to the new Cypress CI env",
