      "message": "Hi @Kaustubh (KD)\nWhat we have captured in the link (https://docs.instabase.com/apps/create#digitizing-documents) is correct - I can elaborate a bit more here\n• By default we will process all layers in a PDF that is present and extract information across both image and text elements.\n• Skew/warp in input images / document pages are handled and corrected before extraction.\n• Any attachments are processed and added to conversation / project and get processed through.\n• Signatures and barcodes in the page are detected by default and signature barcode markers + barcode text is added to text space.\n• Handwritten text if any is detected during OCR process\n• Rotated pages / rotated text in input is handled by OCR during extraction phase.\n• If non-latin configuration is enabled in OCR, foreign languages are also extracted and represented in text.\n• We have other pre/post processing settings in platform settings (https://platform.instabase.com/docs/automate-workflows/step-config-reference/process-files/index.html), we don't do those by default currently and they are not exposed in OCR config in AIHub.\ncc: @melissa.amos",
