      "message": "I'm really really struggling getting a list of values out of fairly easy tables, and do so consistently. Object detection is switched on. This is in Prod. No matter how refined my prompt, lists frequently come out in the wrong order, or have random N/As included. It would be really helpful if I could point and click on the value I'm looking for. I'm wondering if we could do some sort of Goal-seek in the background - ie. point and click and we solve for the required prompt.\n\nSome screenshots below. I have tried probably 50-100 prompt variations. I'm sure one of our SEs could get it out, but as a regular user, this becomes quickly very frustrating.",

I can add your example to the ticket.\n\nIn your example, are you trying to get the \"Pd\" item for each row? Can you describe more what you're looking for?\n\nCan you also attach the sample doc?",

I'm using List of objects, not table. It works well on most others values. I have shared my project here (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/ece2896e-c023-4af0-b6f2-3aed2c822892).
