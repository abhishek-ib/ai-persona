Is this the parameter you'd use to trigger a manual check of an upstream drive integration? Are there any other specifics users should know about how to do that? \n2. With the addition of upstream mailbox connectors, is there a way to trigger a check of upstream mailboxes with this endpoint?\ncc: @Anil @tony.shi @Jessica @Chris Cowell",

And we did just add the ability to do this, good catch!! Instead of specifying an `input_dir`, they can instead pass in `manual_upstream_integration: true` . For upstream drive integrations, that's all they have to do, and it will trigger a check of their specified source folder. If it's an email integration, they also need to specify a `from_timestamp` and `to_timestamp`, which are numbers in milliseconds.",

Whenever the deployment is run, it will take any and all files from in there.\n\nFor mailboxes, there are a couple of different ways it figures this out:\n1. The received after date in the filters, like you said\n2. When you're running the integration manually, we use that received after date + the from_timestamp and to_timestamp - so you'll get everything between those timestamps, that are received after the specified date in the filter\n3. When the mailbox is running on a schedule, we do something a little more complicated. The first run will take everything after the received after date (or from the beginning of time, if not specified). We will then save what the last email we pulled was. Then, for the next run, we'll pull everything after that one, so there's no overlap and we don't process emails twice.",

Rather, we will crawl back one interval window and start from there. For example, if the schedule is set to “Daily”, the first run would fetch all emails that were received in the last day. The next run (following day) will pick up where the first run left off… etc",
