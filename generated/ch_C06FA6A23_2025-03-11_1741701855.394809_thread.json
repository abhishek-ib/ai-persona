None of those nodes are around currently (didn't get 'stuck')\n3. The build environment for these is containerized, and the `bazel` cache local to the build is *NOT* persisted to the host FS (no bind mounts of `/home/ubuntu/.cache/bazel`)\n4. The network flakiness hypothesis from @sean.donohoe makes sense in light of previous experiences, but I don't know why it's suddenly so consistent. :thinking_face:",
