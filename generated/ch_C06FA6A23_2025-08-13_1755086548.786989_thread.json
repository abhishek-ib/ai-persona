Not sure if this is the best channel for this ask, so feel free to point me in the right direction if there’s a better place.\n\nJPMC is looking to test beyond what our standard AI Hub smoke testing covers. We’ll be sharing our smoke testing details, but their request goes a bit further.\n\nDo we have a *customer-facing checklist* we could share for executing these broader tests? And is there anything (apps, scripts, etc.) we could provide to help them run them on their side?\n\nAppreciate any pointers so we can make sure they’re set up for success.\n\ncc: @subbu",

They might want to run these tests on recurring basis post upgrades etc.\nWe have shared the Load testing script that @Anil has built. Additionally, to support other tests, is there anything we internally use that can be shared with them? Apart from whatever is listed if there are any checklists the customer should be performing to validate the env?\nNote - Customer is on their VPC, connecting to their own LLM endpoint.\n\nCC - @Nithin",
