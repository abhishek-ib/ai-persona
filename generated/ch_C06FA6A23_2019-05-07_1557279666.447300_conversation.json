We eventually moved to `runlocal` for local development due to faster builds. We also had `docker compose`. I am pretty certain that some members of our development community won't be happy about slowness that will be introduced due to docker builds.\n[2] Do you have an example of `non-linux friendly Makefile`? I will like to take a look.\n[3] `Minikube` is great. But, I do doubt whether majority of developers will use it. Some of us will, but most probably not.",
