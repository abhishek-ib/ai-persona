This (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/187900cc-8937-4fd5-9209-528879f51aa0) was the one I had bookmarked and this (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/0686b7fe-c04c-42ea-ab3f-4c940abc1baa) is the one from the marketplace. If it was updated, is there a way to redirect/maintain the first one so it still works?",

Or maybe a way to have the docsbot’s browser URL be the app name version of the URL?",

In case of community chatbot, since the URL won't change the automatic redirection was not enabled.\n\nHowever we are observing this pattern, the name based URL (for community chatbot) is getting resolved to ID based URL and the users are bookmarking the same from the browser. I am creating a ticket to track this request and enable automatic redirection for community chatbots.\n\nhttps://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3203 cc: @avi @margaret.tomaszczuk",
