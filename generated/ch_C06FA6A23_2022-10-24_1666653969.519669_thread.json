For more context, profile pictures do not work for any customer, and have never worked because profile pics are actually supposed to be stored in a public S3/NFS drive. So no customer would ever have a public S3 bucket, and even we would never put up a public NFS drive.\n\nDuring 22.08 UAT, I have discussed this with Yan and Heymian and we decided to leave it as is since we don't have resource to do the redesign of this implementation and this component doesn't have high impact. If needed, we could consider disabling this feature.",
