When you are doing classify extract (whole doc becomes single class) or split-classify extract (a single doc can have multiple classes) - when doing first time - call the API like in the script below\nhttps://github.com/instabase/benchmarks/blob/master/scripts/gemini_classify_extract.py\n\n2. In Build, if you want to re-extract on a specific slice like when someone adds a field\nYou can do this by adding the whole PDF and adding to the prompt\n```Only consider pages 2-3```\n^ something like this\nSeems to work reasonably well.\n\n3. In app-run human review, if someone changes class, we want to re-extract\nFor this again, we can use the above logic where we pass the page number range to restrict the search\n\nAs long as page range is contiguous, this should work fine.",
