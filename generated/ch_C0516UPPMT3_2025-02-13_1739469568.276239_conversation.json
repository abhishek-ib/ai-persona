      "message": ":rocket: *AI Hub: App UX Update – Internal Opt-out coming in 25.06!* :rocket:\n\nHey team, a big update to AI Hub’s App UX is on the way! :tada: This release improves *app navigation, versioning, testing, and deployments*—all designed to make it easier for users to create, test, share, and deploy apps.\n\n:small_blue_diamond: *What’s New?*\n\n:white_check_mark: Clearer navigation between Projects, Apps, and Deployments\n:white_check_mark: Ability to view app schemas from prior app versions\n:white_check_mark: Improved guidance for testing, versioning, and sharing\n:white_check_mark: Improved UI for managing app settings\n\n:small_blue_diamond: *What should I do now?*\n\n• If you actively demo AI Hub to customers and *want to continue using the old apps UI* until *25.10*, disable 'Enable new navigation top bar' and 'Enable new user interface for apps' internal preview features when *25.06* deploys (~Tuesday next week).\n• If you want to start using the new UI sooner, enable the above preview features *today*! Things work pretty well in 25.04, but we're always looking for more feedback in <#C0516UPPMT3|>\n• If you missed the :film_projector: demo from the February 4 AI Hub Advancements session, catch up here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EoQBx6JXcqm_GPa3UdmLcwxWyXdSlZ4i/view) (~30:00-39:00).\n:camera_with_flash: Screenshot of the new UI attached!\n\nThe feature is *opt-in now*, internal *opt-out* is slated for *25.06* (Tuesday next week), with general availability targeted for *25.10*. Stay tuned for updates, and let us know if you have any questions!",
