This is not possible right now - as all of the event calculation is done in Metronoome. I can't think of a workaround right now. We will keep this in mind as we invest in exposing more granular activity/cost reporting to the customer (do you mind adding these details to this ticket: https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2318\n3. Good data point that shows we're investing in the right direction! Copying in @jack.robbins @Jessica here for the doc STP feature that is planned. \n4. @Kaustubh (KD) @Jianqi Xing another customer we might be able to speak about for case mgmt.",

I know that Varun mentioned that there will be list mile configuration that we need to do, just curious whether that effort will different across the product surfaces.\n\n@Hamish lets connect on the case management piece today as well when we sync",
