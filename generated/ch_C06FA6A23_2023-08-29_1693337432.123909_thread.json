It will be best to partner with other engineering managers on making changes to this SDK as this can be used as a one-stop shop for managing communication with Instabase via APIs\n\nYou can read more about this SDK here - https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SAAS/pages/1784315936/Instabase+SDK+for+Python\n\nThere is also a go version of this SDK: https://github.com/instabase/instabase-sdk-go which we should try to keep in sync with python.\n\ncc @Heymian @shaunak and @Kerry for visibility",
