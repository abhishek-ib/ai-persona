So far the answers I've received have been fantastic.\n\nCurious question related to this replacement of Benji:\n> Is it known/accepted that Instabasers from any region can access+interact with the chatbots from other regions?  It's not necessarily a problem in my opinion, as they're simply providing answers I likely could find on my own if searching Drive or Confluence, but I bring it up because access was strictly limited to one's own region during the Benji implementation.",

Please continue to use these chatbots and share feedback (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJJSSt5rRptsiQoGn2IhnO6RzlPJEY3aVUFU-DCfCrxJ3tRA/viewform) on good/bad answers. It'll help our team improve the product.\n\nRe: access to regional chatbots - we are aware that they're accessible to all at the moment. Even with Benji, I could have gone to <#C06CVKGHL13|> as an India employee and asked a questions since the channel was public. We are ok with internal employees having the discretion to use the appropriate chatbot.\n\nExternally though If we win a deal, it seems likely that an enterprise may want to rollout a chatbot to only a small subset of employees. This is especially true when the chatbot is used via AI Hub directly v/s API. We are monitoring for this signal and will prioritise accordingly. cc: @Balaram",
