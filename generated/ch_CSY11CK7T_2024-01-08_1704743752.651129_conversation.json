Each week I'll send out a schedule; for each day, someone will be in charge of sending out a Cypress or unit testing tip or trick. We'll then record them here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2180546832/Daily+testing+tips+tricks) for posterity. These don't have to be super esoteric or fancy that no one on the team knows - just something you've found useful that you've come across! We just want to keep the testing spirit alive :ghost: For example, mine on Tuesday will be about testing different window context values in unit tests.\n\nTues 1/16: @Jessica\nWed 1/17: @Xindi Xu\nThurs 1/18: @William Helmrath\nFri 1/19: @Arjun\n\n(Order determined by the FE guild facilitator schedule :slightly_smiling_face: )",
