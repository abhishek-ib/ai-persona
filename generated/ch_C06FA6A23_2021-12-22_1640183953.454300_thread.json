      "message": "Hi Team,\nWe try to add all the possible fields for an app to our marketplace apps. A lot of customers requests for few fields/custom fields which can be derived from whatever we have as part of our marketplace app. They might ask for output in a JSON/CSV format.\nPresently what we try to do is:\n1.  We go back to our marketplace app’s flow. Add an extra step to reduce the number of fields or increase the number of fields. At times, we write logics to derive some extra fields. \n2. We add post-flow scripts to generate output in a CSV/ JSON.\n3. We re-compile the flow and then ship it to the customer.\nCons for this approach: We always have to go back to the marketplace flow and customize it. Making it difficult to maintain the customized version which we are shipping.\n\nPossible approach where we won’t have to touch the codebase/flow of the app?\n1. It will be great if we can have a ‘marketplace-app’ step as part of flow v3. That way, we will never have to go back and customize the existing marketplace app. We have already spoken about this with @Rakesh.\n2. Having a flow with an apply-udf step where we can trigger the marketplace app via an API. Then do post processing on its output.\n        - The above approach might have a lot of scenarios/cases which we will have to handle.\n          For example, -\n                - Timing out of the apply-udf step because of the marketplace app flow taking a lot of time for its completion.\n                - Whether the flow triggered via the UDF will have enough resources to run fast like a normal flow?\nI will need suggestion whether this 2nd possible approach is a feasible one for all the marketplace apps that we have and what all things/scenarios we should handle if we are taking this approach?\ncc: @Nithin",
