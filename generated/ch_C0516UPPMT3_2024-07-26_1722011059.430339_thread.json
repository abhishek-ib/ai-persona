      "message": "Hey team, just had a half-way POC check-in with a prospect ISB, where they are building the solution themselves. A couple of pieces of feedback from them that I thought would be worth sharing.\n1. They want to apply a set of rules on top of extractions. When I showed the them custom function field types (derived fields), their response was 'Wow, this is incredible. Exactly what I was looking to do - when can I use this myself?'\n2. One step more advanced for the above use case ^. They want to be able to run extracted results against multiple documents that state some rules, and the rules that are applied will change state to state. Instead of hard-coding a tonne of complex rules in IB, they would like to query the rules docs using the extracted results. \n    a. I have suggested that he tries putting the results from Build into a chatbot or multi-doc Converse project, and ask the system to apply the rules for him. \n    b. Long-term, this would mean chaining together API calls between Build + Converse. Have we seen this crop up with other customers? If so, we might want to consider an easier workflow to make this possible?\n3. Customer had been using the table view in HR. He didn't like that the table results didn't show validation results + error messages, and actually thought this was a bug (see image below). \n    a. He also didn't seem to be aware of the filter options available (review docs, execution errors etc). In my own experience, almost no-one seems to know about the expand button next to the filters that unhides the assigned classes. These buttons maybe need some redesign thought?\n4. In Build view, he didn't like that for custom validations, we don't print the error message for a failed validation (see below image). We only show 'Fail' in the results table, and nothing in the logs. This led him to believe that there was no way of reviewers seeing the message long term - in his mind a big problem moving forward.\ncc @Nico",
