As way of feedback, I tried the following:\n• _What are the new features in the latest AI Hub release?_ This gave me a long list of features from various releases.\n• _What is the latest release of AI Hub, and what features are in it?_ This gave me a list of features from 23.43(?!?)\n• _What is the the most recent release of AI Hub, and what features are in it?_ This was the winner and gave me a correct answer.",

Ideally we beef up the model to support these out of box. @Hari @vineeth @Sławek Biel FYI\n2. For the credits issue, I pinged in https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1720669981194339 to try to get the service account loaded with more credits \nLet me know once you update the docsbot with these sample prompts, I can make sure to republish the latest version to the marketplace",
