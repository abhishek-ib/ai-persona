From there I have to download the translated doc and highlight each area to Microsoft Word in order to read what the doc fully says in English.  Is there a quicker way to do this?  Please find attached example doc for reference before and after AIHub translation.",

      "message": "The Doc Translation app uses a version of `instabase.pdf_utils.pdf_image_converter.PdfImageConverter` to get the images of a machine readable PDF without the original text, so that we can write translated text on top. In this case, it looks like the class returned images including the text. Since this is not happening for other machine readable PDFs, I think maybe this PDF is using an unusual operator to write text and we are not excluding that? I'm not that familiar with PDF internals. <!subteam^S05TRT53J8N> / @Gaurav Saini can you help?",
