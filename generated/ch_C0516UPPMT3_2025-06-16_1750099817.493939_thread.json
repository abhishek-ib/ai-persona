      "message": "Adding a huge +1 to this one again -- I am currently doing manual runs for a demo deployment, but weekends pretty much set our 7-day view back, meaning we rarely have a window to show a full 7-day view -- and I also frequently forget to run a deployment + review runs in time. I've also heard from CEMs that metrics are a popular demo request. It may also drive adoption for folks to be able to play around with a stubby solution since they'll: a) better understand the automate solution pattern, and b) be familiar with the UI.\n\nLike how this tensorflow visualizer (https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.31925&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) helps to understand neural networks, something interactive/stubby is super beneficial.\n\nCC: @rachel.datlowe as it relates to long term customer enablement",
