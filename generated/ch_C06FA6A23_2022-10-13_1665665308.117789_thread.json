New functionality comes out in a .0 release and then a .1 or .2 is a series of patches over the next period of time.  It might be a model to consider as our customers have this general expectation",

      "message": "We do currently have patch releases. For example we are currently on 22.08.9 on the 22.08 major release branch. And patch releases include continuous bug fixes and security vulnerability to stabilize further.\n\nThe major releases are cuts that include the introduction of new features, APIs or deprecations. We don’t send new features back to old releases because they’re typically large, and risk destabilizing the older branch. You can find more details here as well (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1739194377/Release+Support+Policy).",
