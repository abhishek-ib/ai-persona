On the passport it is written like 01 APR/APR 2015, so I asked it to change it to dd/mm/yyyy on the first field. Then the result of the second field changed to this format as well (without me changing the second field). When I then ran the document through the app it would return dd/mm/yyyy for the first field but 01 APR/APR 2015 for the 2nd field.",
