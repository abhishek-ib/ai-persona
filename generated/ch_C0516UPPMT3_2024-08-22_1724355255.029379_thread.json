      "message": "Just tested this on aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com). we added an S3 and created inbound  integration using scheduler and outbound to a particular folder. the deployment was run by a user called *\"upstream integration\"*. on the drive the output folder mentioned it as an *\"internalIBrunner\".* So looks like even if the user is deleted from org. this runner is acting as a service account.\n*Couple of questions/ observations in this case*\n1. why cant we replicate the same experience with API and auth tokens so that the APIs Auth token are created for an internalIBrunner and not for individuals? \n2. Whenever I used the scheduler with the rule saying pick up files when they are found on the folder, The job ran again and again on the folder, So is the expectation that the customer should remove the docs from the folder once our job gets triggered? If so should we ask customer to build a script on calling our run app api check for status and then delete/ move the files from the folder? Is there anyway we can provide configuration for this functionality to run the file on landing and may be mark/ move it to archives or something",

      "message": "Okay cool, that's the intended behavior! The user isn't actually named \"Upstream integration\", we just replace the text with that when we see it's run by that service account.\n\n1. @Elan Sharony can you speak to this?\n2. The scheduler job should also remove the documents from that folder once they're detected, is that not the behavior you're seeing? @tony.shi for visibility here",

      "message": "On 2: nope the scheduler kept running on the same docs again and again. I have multiple runs on the same files so the scheduler is not deleting them currently. Let me know if i have something configured wrong. The deployments can be seen on SolEngWorkspace run by upstream integration.  Also is there any documentation on how the scheduler performs? I mean what happens if the job fails? Will the doc be still deleted or be there to pick up for next run etc?",

Are you asking why the org runner service account's API auth token (internalIBrunner) isn't accessible to users within the org? cc @BG",

Why not have auth tokens for this IBrunner service account that can be generated by admins and used for API integrations?",
