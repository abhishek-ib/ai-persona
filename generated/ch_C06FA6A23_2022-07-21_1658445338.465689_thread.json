I reran it today and the jenkins pipeline (https://jenkins.instabase.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/instabase/detail/PR-28588/3/pipeline/) shows that it is picking up code changes for a million files that this PR didn't touch. (As a reference, the pipeline only ran one file (https://jenkins.instabase.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/instabase/detail/PR-28588/1/pipeline/) first time I triggered it) As a result it is testing almost all the packages. I did a rough look up and it looks like all of those files are all touched within the last week.",

When we do git diff we compare to `remotes/origin/master`  so the script must have picked up all these diffs and run all these tests.",
