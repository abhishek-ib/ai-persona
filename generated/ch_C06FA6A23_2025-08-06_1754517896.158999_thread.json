      "message": ":wave-hello-goodbye: Friendly reminder! Please use the ECR pull-through cache for DockerHub-hosted images, as DockerHub has unreasonably low rate limits even for authenticated users unless we pay for a Pro or Business account. :sweat_smile:\n\nThis causes things to fall over more than they otherwise would, particularly as our automated builds are consolidated to a small set of IPs that DockerHub tracks for rate limiting.\n\nFor reference, the limit on pulls per 6 hours for unauthenticated / anonymous pulls (which is all of our usage in pipelines) is 100 per IP block - so something like one pull every 3.6 minutes. :melting_face:\n\nThere are lots of examples in the code base, but the pattern to use is `<ecr_url>/docker-hub/<image>:<tag>`\nThis way our ECR registry just pulls each tag once, and then serves it from ECRs backend instead of us hitting DockerHub's crazy low limits. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThanks!",
