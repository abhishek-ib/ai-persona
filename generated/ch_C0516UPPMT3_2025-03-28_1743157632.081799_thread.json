If a customer asks us to identify the given page as Class A+Class B, we can achieve by naming Class A_B and write prompts to identify both. If the ask is to Crop Class A and Class B in a given page, then explore advanced app to crop (Not done in any use cases yet).  \n2. This can be done through the Advanced app and we have experience here. \n3. Need EPD help to answer.  \n4. We can achieve Advanced app\n5. We haven't done this but we can explore this using the Advanced app (Build a custom entity model to identify the images and redact image). \nWhat would be the volume and value for this? Since there are many Advanced app Requirements, I'm curious to know. \n\ncc @Varun Nandan (ANZ vis.)",
