      "message": "Hey, when searching for content in documents while building projects it would be really useful if the ctrl-f functionality could be improved. At the moment, when I ctrl-f a term I can find it in the OCR view, but have no way of figuring out where this corresponding data is within the pdf view to debug why it may/may not be being picked out.\n\nI'd like a 'Go to section in PDF' button that drags me to the equivalent text section the PDF when browsing the OCR view. They have this functionality in Overleaf when writing Latex and its really useful",
