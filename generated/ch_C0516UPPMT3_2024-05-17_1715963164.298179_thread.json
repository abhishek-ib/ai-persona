We have an AI Hub commercial multitenant deal on the table and they have asked for the Azure Open AI end point in Europe.

(Maybe there's a duplicate ticket that we're not aware of; our goal has been really to enable the field to self-serve product progress through Jira, so this is something that we can improve).\n\nSecond, @hannah you are correct here -- as of now the API key is set at the tenant level, we don't have the ability to set at a org level.",
