      "message": "Thanks for flagging! We have different behavior for build and converse when the default drive changes.\n• for build, the user can either migrate the project to the new drive to keep working or delete the project\n• For converse, since we can’t support migration yet, we only allow a user to converse with the existing files, but a user can’t add any new files\nI agree with the feedback that a regular user might not really know what a default drive is so it may be confusing when they encounter this message. That said, the messages are important as we need the user to make an active choice for build and we also need the use to be aware that they can’t add new files to converse. I’m future, for converse, we will eventually be able to support moving files to new default drive so the option will look like what we have for build. This is technical limitation for right now \n\n@jean @Rosie it would be great to see if we can propose new copy for both the build notification and the converse notification to make this more clear for the user.",
