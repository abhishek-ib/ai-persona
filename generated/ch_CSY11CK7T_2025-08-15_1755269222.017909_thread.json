      "message": "Question for FE folks: I am still new to codebase and I see other apps thats are not AI Hub also sharing a component I need to touch (`IBRecordManager`). However, I do see the last time someone touched the file (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/webserver/shared/src/js/webpacked/lib/src/IBRecordManager/main.tsx) was about 18 months ago.\n\nDo we still maintain `ml-studio` and `flow-review` apps? I am currently considering creating a copy of IBRecordManager for the single use-case in AI Hub under HR grid view (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/fa1f96379fa0012bd3e0d235a13e63e64f8450da/webserver/shared/src/js/webpacked/apps/src/aihub/features/Review/components/DocumentGrid/index.tsx#L253C1-L254C1) as I don't see how useful it would be to maintain reusability here across legacy apps especially for newer designs/use-cases.",

Well, not an exact copy (just copy the name of the component) but more-so a fresh new V2 just for AI-Hub because the code seems to be outdated and there are some performance improvements + cleanup I was going to add to help with large documents.\n\n> to answer your question, we do not do any active development on `ml-studio` and `flow-review`, but solution engineers still need to use these apps on AI Hub environments to build advanced apps\nIf that's the case, I also see the last change in `IBRecordManager` were mainly just copy changes (for the legacy apps) from 18 months ago and the actual logic was written 3-4 years ago. I feel a bit uncomfortable changing the logic of the component and I don't think it would make sense to test all the legacy apps that use it as well which was why I considered separating it out as a new component just for AIHub. It shouldn't be too bad because right now the component is used in 4 different files and 3 of them are legacy.",
