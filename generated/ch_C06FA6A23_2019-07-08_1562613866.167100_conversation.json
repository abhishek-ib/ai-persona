The summary is here:\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/10333\n\nThe most dangerous and wide ranging changes are for ApiUtils/AjaxUtils (any polling + fetch to apis) and StrUtils (pathing helpers lstrip/rstrip, etc). If anyone run into issues with methods not defined or imports not found in any javascript files, PM me or shame me publicly on here :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\n\nCustomer success folks if you find anything broken with the UI that wasnt discovered before once this is on dogfood, also point them at me unless you know specifically who might've broken it.",
