The docs are the canonical source of truth about the product and should not be buried under the user avatar. We should make the community forum easy to get to, yes, but it’s in no way a substitute for the proper docs.",

So, the nav work appears to have pared back the top-level icons quite a bit. Good!\n\nBut, we seem to have optimized for the wrong thing here:\n• Docs warrant a top-level icon if anything does. \n• We have redundant access points for the forum, with both a button AND a menu item.\n• The question mark is ambiguous. Question mark icons are widely used to indicate help, but we're using it for feedback?\nSince we're deprecating community accounts, this issue might just resolve itself. But, the paradigm that got us here warrants reconsidering. If we're making tough choices about what deserves prime real estate in the navigation, documentation should take precedence over the forum (which is not a source of truth) and over the feedback option (which is not self-serve).",
