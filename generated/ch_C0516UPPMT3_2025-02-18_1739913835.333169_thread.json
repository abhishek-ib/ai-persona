      "message": "I asked in a Visual Reasoning prompt to describe images in an article and only describe images that take up more than a quarter of a page. It picked one on the first page and another one page 8, and decided to ignore others. Tweaked the prompt a bit (SS6) and it only picked up on the first page picture. Asking it to describe all images still missed a couple (SS7). Since this is a longer doc than 7 pages, I'm assuming the \"relevant pages\" that get sent to the vision model are missing some pages?

      "message": "Yeah this is an area where it will not do well for a few reasons. One is def the lack of visual retrieval (its going to retrieve relevant pages based on the text on the document) - here I'm not sure how it knows which page has a picture. In general the exhaustive searching across the large documents for images will not work well",
