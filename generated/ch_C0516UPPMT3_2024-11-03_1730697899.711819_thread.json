      "message": "Hi team,\nWe have been publishing apps (bank statement, passport, driving license, etc.) on the AIHub Marketplace. We were wondering if there is any way to track how many times a particular app has been used by people. I know we can get some metrics once we deploy the app, but I’m curious if there’s anything available for published apps to see how many times each app has been run. This would give us insight into which apps are more popular and which may need improvements.\ncc: @Anshu @Nithin",
