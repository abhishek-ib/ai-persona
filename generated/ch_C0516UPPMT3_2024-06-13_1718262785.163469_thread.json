      "message": "Great to hear that the chatbot is doing well to provide answers based on the current knowledge. For publishing, we have a few choices depending on handling copyrighted info.\n• Publish as unlisted chatbot - the chatbot won't show up in marketplace, no CTA on the chatbot to encourage user to `create their own chatbot`\n    ◦ Since this is a growth hack v/s something relevant to all customers, I think we should go in this direction\n    ◦ We can publish this from a user's account v/s Instabase - users have lesser responsibility about what source content they use. So potentially can include more content too.\n• Publish as marketplace chatbot - it will show in app store, there will be a CTA on the chatbot encouraging a user to `create their own chatbot` \nWe don't have forking a chatbot on the roadmap yet, can look into it based on more feedback. For now we have this create your own chatbot CTA which leads down this path.",
