Can I ask it \"verify that the amount on Doc 1 matches an entry on Doc 2\"\nFeedback: When I asked it to describe each document, it referred to them as \"Document 0\", \"Document 1\" and \"Document 2\". Can we have it return the file names instead.",

We are looking for a lot of similar feedback from our teams and early users to help us improve and extend the capabilities! Keep it coming :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n@Hari @Sławek Biel - can we look into referring the file names in output response vs arbitrary document #s?",
