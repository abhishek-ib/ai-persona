This way new nginx configs only have to be added in one place.\n\nI was able to do this for saas and dogfood pretty easily, but the prod nginx-config is much different. For example, it has a separate server block for staging.instabase.com (http://staging.instabase.com) that seems to be a partial duplicate of the other one.",
