I can imagine ops members getting annoyed at this rate - is it a function of the doc size of the use case we are dealing with or is it the same speed across all use cases?\n2. Is the load time included in review metrics? As an ops member I'd be annoyed if this was impacting my metrics\ncc @jack.robbins",
