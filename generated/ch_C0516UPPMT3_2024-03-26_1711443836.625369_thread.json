Not sure how that would work, since Academy isn’t really geared toward quick answers in the way docs are. Plus all the information in Academy is also in docs. :thinking_face: We _are_ looking at adding some of the Academy guides to docs, so that might be the answer.\n\nIn any case, I will think about the Academy piece and see what we can come up with!",
