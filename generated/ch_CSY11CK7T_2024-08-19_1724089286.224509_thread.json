This is useful for newly created Cypress testsâ€“we can test if all the env setup is correct and fix any flaky issues before turning it into merge blocking.\nThe `@skip-ci` tag is used to mark tests not to run in CI. This is useful for tests that cause concurrency issues. For example, the `drives.spec.ts` test will change the default drive which will break other Cypress tests.",
