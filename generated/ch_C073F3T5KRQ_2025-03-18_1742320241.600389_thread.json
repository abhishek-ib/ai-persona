What I've been doing is unstaging everything, removing the non *.proto* generated files and rerunning `cd ~/instabase/webserver/api-server/ && poetry run make build-protos` to build them. However, I was wondering if the implementation for the command could just use the changed files (as compared to the base commit on the master branch) to rebuild them",

I was rebasing everything but the proto file and that's why the files with merge conflicts were not updated.\n\nin my case, the merge conflicts in the proto file are able to be automatically resolved so no changes were needed to those files. The solution provided makes this low priority but I was wondering if it could be automatically handled by the script",
