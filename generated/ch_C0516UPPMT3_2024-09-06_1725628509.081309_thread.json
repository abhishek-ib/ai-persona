      "message": "Hey, I have a prospect who has built their own application using the Converse APIs. They are currently experiencing a product gap where by they want the ability to return to a previous conversation and understand the history of previous questions asked, but can't do this over API.\n\nCurrently, his app sends a list of pre-defined questions and then surfaces the responses to the user. If the user wants to ask additional questions in the future, he would then have to build functionality to store and display all historical queries (rather than being able to just pull this history through the APIs). Through the UI in AI Hub, you can always return to a previous conversation to ask more questions, and see a list of previous questions.\n\nAny plans for this kind of functionality?\n\ncc @avi @Balaram",
