      "message": "<!subteam^S01DXHX6FPT> I ran few flows from my account ('Shubhu') on ib.com (http://ib.com) and was trying to refer them back in the metrics app (I have access to that). But while trying to find relevant filter values in 'repo' , 'flow path' , 'user' , etc I couldn't find the actual value... for example, my repo name is 'metrics' where I ran all the flows but in the metrics app, I can't find any such repo in the repo dropdown.. similarly for 'flow path', I couldn't find the flow path on which I ran the flows.. pasting an example flow path here: https://instabase.com/apps/flow/edit/Shubhu/metrics/fs/Instabase%20Drive/ca_docs%20(1)/ca-docs.ibflow\n\nCan someone help with this? I need to present something to SC on how the metrics numbers are calculated and so it is critical to get this working..",
