      "message": "Hey team, didn't find a better channel but I have a question regarding Instabase modules in Jupyter Notebook:\nWe have a user testing in their Dev env importing:\n```from instabase.content.filehandle import ibfile\n(which ended up with error below)\nTypeError: __new__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'serialized_options'```\nAnd also\n```from instabase.clients_factory_utils.clients_factory import file_client\n(which ended up with error below)\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'redis'```\nI know we don't have all Instabase modules installed as there can be multiple dependencies. But can anyone suggest about these 2 above?\n\nI have tried on ib.com (http://ib.com), neither modules are available to import.\nBut in Dogfood, import ib_file as above works fine; import file_client as above lead to the same error for missing redis.",
