      "message": "Hey Fellow Frontend Devs,\nWe've started a journey to standardize the structure of our AI Hub frontend code, aiming for a more optimized and scalable codebase. I've put together a simple structure that outlines how we can gradually introduce these changes.\n\nI've created a document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_luXmNqjVe2KIso08XxYZUS8ZKSpb9XmpINzOo3LbNY/edit?usp=sharing) explaining the new structure, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on it. If you attended the meeting, please start implementing these changes. If you couldn't make it, don't worryâ€”reach out to me or anyone who was there for a recap.\n\nLet's make this transition smooth and effective together. Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions.\n\nThanks, and happy coding!",
