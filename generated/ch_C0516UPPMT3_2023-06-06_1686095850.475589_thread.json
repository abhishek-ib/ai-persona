      "message": "I've been seeing a common theme in showing AIHub to different people today.  They play around with converse and send me a screenshots of it not really working for any of their some what more complicated queries, often time converse just saying it can't do that.  Once I tell them to try Advanced Mode, everything they are trying to do works wonderfully and they are very impressed.  I don't think they would have figured out that there's an Advanced mode without me telling them. I think Advanced Mode needs to be more easily discoverable when things aren't working well in Default mode.",
