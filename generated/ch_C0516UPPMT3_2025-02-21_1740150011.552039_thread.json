      "message": "Yes, I think that would be useful. I did notice that in creation, you can specify the name. It did not look like we could change it after if a user leaves the default. I wonder if we could run the config together so that the name and the bucket or other detail is on the same config page. Alternatively, what about naming the datasource after specifying the detail. It would be nice to auto generate a name by default that would be specific and let the user override. In this case, I would like \"S3: ai-hub-bank-demo\" where if the user doesn't update, we have a compact name that still has meaning.",
