      "message": "Hey all! As you know, the Docs team would like to get release note information on _every user-facing change_. Usually, that’s in EPD initiatives or EPD bug fixes. But if you have a user-facing bug fix (any bug a user did or might have encountered) or another user-facing change and there’s no EPD ticket, please still include a release note.\n\nWhen the Docs team sees a ticket that we think might need a release note, and there isn’t one, we do two things:\n1. Ask in the ticket for the release note and sometimes, for clarification on whether a note is needed.\n2. Label the ticket as `relnote-needsinfo`.\nRight now, we have 13 tickets marked with this label. Some are for the current release, but others are where we’ve asked for information and never received it. Please peruse our new “Missing release notes” filter (https://instabase.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10876) to see if you owe the Docs team information. Thank you! :pray:",
