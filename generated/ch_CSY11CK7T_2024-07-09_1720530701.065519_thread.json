(`/api/v2/solutions/deployed/ POST` no longer works)\nAlso looks like there is an existing doc translation app (https://aihub-sandbox.internal.instabase.com/apps/solution-dashboard/solution/Doc%20Translation) in the solution dashboard, but doesn't come up in the AI Hub apps.\nI think just publishing the app to the marketplace will add it to all orgs?",
