      "message": "Hey, it looks like the pre-built classes in Build are not identical to what we offer in marketplace apps. Assuming that marketplace apps are the latest and greatest we can offer, presumably the pre-built classes should reflect these capabilities? The main differences I see (looking at Passport one in particular):\n1. Prompts are different. E.g. for MRZ and DOB the performance is worse in pre-built class\n2. Validations - pre-built classes don't give you validations for the class. This is a large part of the development effort required\nKeen to hear thoughts here\n\ncc @Anshu @Kaustubh (KD)",

      "message": "Yeah this is a known gap, given we've heard a lot more conversation about this recently its worth bringing up.\n• The prebuilt classes was a direction that was the first attempt at introducing a library of classes for increasing time to value. This effort is manual and we have seed new classes every time we want to increase the offering.\n• However, we decided to pause this in favor of customizing apps from the marketplace. This takes advantage of the more advanced work our SolEng teams are doing. \n• There are still gaps around being able to bring in multiple classes from multiple marketplace apps into one project. They are captured here (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-3417).\n• When that happens, we will decide whether we need those pre-built classes",

One question I have is whether we should leverage the same 'App customization' setting that we use for full project copies from apps for class-level reuse. Any thoughts on that? I think it would make sense to reuse that setting here, so that we only support sourcing prebuilt classes from apps where this setting is enabled.",
