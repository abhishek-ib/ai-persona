      "message": "hello! to improve our system tests, we've added the ability to tag on slack when a system test suite times out (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/INSIGHTS-7243). in the past (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C02ACPHNMSQ/p1733173139939749), we've found that system test failures due to timeouts can go unaddressed for long periods of time because no one is tagged. For that reason, we'd like to assign test owners to these system test suites as seen here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/e4dd7b38cd2d988348d65196adcaa3b34881d25a/tools/releasetools/jenkins/system_test_config.json#L722). I've started a spreadsheet to keep track of this (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbQHVuHBV0EvXppbLZblW01pVi5mruDu6asSIGQgun8/edit?gid=0#gid=0), please fill in! cc'ing engineering managers for visibility @lydia @Serena @Heymian @Yash Botadra @andy @Anil @Balaram",

      "message": "for many of these test suites (like aihub-dogfood), we run many tests owned by different people/teams (like converse, build, search all on aihub-dogfood). Unfortunately given how timeouts work, it isn't possible to tag the test owner of the test that timed out. However, this tagging is better than none so ideally we assign these test suites to someone who can best triage them and follow up w/ the relevant folks",

Idk what u had in mind for team handles, but given the options i think on call makes sense, or if there’s a specific team that wants to be tagged, but i think tagging every team who owns tests in that suite might be too much given the breadth of tests we run",
