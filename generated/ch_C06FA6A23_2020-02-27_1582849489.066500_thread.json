      "message": "cc @dlluncor @lydia I’m working on adding line detection to process files so `scan_box` can work regardless of what OCR engine is used (ABBYY has its own line detection; `scan_box` relies on detected lines to run. My line detection is going to be run when creating a converted image). ABBYY and Marx are the only OCR engines used in production, so I assume the only ones I need to take into account for `scan_box`.\n\nI asked @Jonathan Shih about any image rotation that happens:\n• some image orientation correction is happening after OCR based on the found word box coordinates and this is done for abbyy and google but not Marx.\n• `correct_orientation_fine` is an option in the OCR Config and this will correct any necessary rotation in images before its going through OCR. If this happens, this happens before line detection is done (in current implementation).\nIn production, Marx is the only OCR engine that may want this custom line detection, assuming the above is correct, it should be fine to have it pre-OCR?\n\n@Aaron Tami do you have any comments on this?",
