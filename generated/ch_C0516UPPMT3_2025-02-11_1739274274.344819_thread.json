That would help us review it in the backlog for future prioritization.\n\nRegarding the production vs. pre-production default, we're updating the terminology and simplifying the process for sharing apps within an organization as part of the new Apps UX. Since we recently reviewed the terminology and visibility defaults, we’d like to keep them stable for now to gather more customer feedback - but we’re definitely open to adjusting defaults in the future.",
