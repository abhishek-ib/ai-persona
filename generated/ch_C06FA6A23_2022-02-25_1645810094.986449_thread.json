      "message": "Since this seems wide spread on the API ill post it in this space, on our APIs it seems that any bad request will always result in a 200 Ok. If one hits /api/v1 with no data you will still receive a 200 with a json response indicating status: ERROR. Is this our go forward strategy for error handling in the api or is this a known issue we have on the backlog",

      "message": "Yeah unfortunate design from the early days that propagated to today, mostly to maintain consistency. Everything returns 200 and you have to look at the body of the response to get the error. This will not be true for API /v2 which is just starting to get rolled out, starting with file-system API which will return proper http codes. We plan to also try to enforce more guidelines around naming of routes (underscores vs dashes) and verbs (when to use GET/POST) so that there is more consistency.",
