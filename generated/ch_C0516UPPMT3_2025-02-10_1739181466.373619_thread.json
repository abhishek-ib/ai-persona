      "message": "Hey team, I have been asked about a use case for using a Chatbot to check query documents vs guideline documents. I know we have this feature as internal preview at least. Couple of questions on this:\n• Can this be done via API? \n    ◦ If not, do we have plans to make it so?\n• The customer wants to run a check for each document passing through their Build app. Do we see any issues with using a custom function/validation function to call the Converse APIs to run a check?\n    ◦ This would be passing the required extracted info through the Converse prompt (instead of using a file to query for now)\n    ◦ Some related discussion was here: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05BJCNKZAM/p1737528121883679",

If there is a customer use case around this, then we can prioritise this work over others\n• #2 - we should be able to use the Converse APIs with build. Since there are no flows involved with Converse APIs we should be good\n@Gauti",

GNP (prospect) wanted to process contracts to see if they complied with policies & regulations. The regulations could change contract to contract, and are sometimes too long to fit in a prompt. They were going to start with Converse using APIs, but if they wanted to build in a validations & review workflow, would need to use Build.",
