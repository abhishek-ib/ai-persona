Jobs will be managed by the release team and prod eng team.\n\nThe only direct impact at the moment is that *`all release certify needs to be requested in #certify-release and be conducted by release engineering or prod eng team`*\n\nonce we complete the migration we will open up write permissions in jenkins.instabase.com (http://jenkins.instabase.com)\nquestions or comments, please feel free to post to <#C035SLYCJ9X|>",
