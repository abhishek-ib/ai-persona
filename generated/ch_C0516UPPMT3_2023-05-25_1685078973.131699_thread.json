      "message": "Hi folks, not sure if this has been brought up before. Whenever we hit an error on ai-hub, likely we get redirected to a page from the \"old\" UI that has apps/file explorer icons on the left bar. Apparently the page style is very different from ai-hub, and I think this may make users feel disconnected when errors happen. I think ideally we should redirect to a dedicated page that has the consistent ai-hub UI for errors.",

So to make this change, we need to make the error page \"pluggable\" - for non-aihub environment we have the default error page and for aihub ones we have another.",
