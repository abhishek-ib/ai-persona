The Manage menu appears on the Members tab and the Groups tab and arguably has little to do with managing either.\n\nMaybe making it a settings icon right next to the organization name to leverage visual closeness or moving it to some other tab (or a new dedicated org info and settings tab)? Itâ€™s not a huge deal but definitely something I noticed when updating the docs for managing preview features.",
