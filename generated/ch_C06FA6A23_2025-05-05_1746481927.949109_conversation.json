      "message": "Hi Team,\nIn the current codebase, we have a lot of instances of\n```from instabase.config_utils import config as cur_config\n\n# at the top of the file\napp_config = cur_config.get_config()```\nget_config creates one copy of the config object with 100+ env vars. Adding this to each file leads to multiple copies of the config object leading to increased start-up time, increase memory usage and general bloat.\nI have replaced this with a single global config object. You can simply import it as\n```from instabase.config_utils.config import config as app_config```\nI have replaced 21 instances of this pattern in https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/69395/files\nThere are another 190 instances of this remaining. If you hit an errors due to this let me know.",
