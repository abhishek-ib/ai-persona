I'm assuming that this is only then in the context of Search. However, this is pretty unclear and confusing if you are trying to understand automation limitations. Can someone provide more light here?\n\ncc: @Balaram @Atinder @melissa.amos",

Where if someone connects Google Drive for input, the native Google file types show in the AI Hub file explorer. (According to that thread they’re converted to PDF upon upload though, not sure I ever wrote that down in the docs though :grimacing:)",
