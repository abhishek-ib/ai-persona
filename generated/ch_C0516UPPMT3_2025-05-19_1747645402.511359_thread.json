      "message": "Hey, some feedback we got from NAB about product gaps. Can I get some help understanding what we have tickets for/what I should create a new ticket for?\n1. GitHub integration - every bit of code that is written has to be certified or scanned before it goes into production. Their ideal fix here would be integrate directly with GitHub so any of this code is already tracked and can be scanned directly. I know we have discussed GitHub style integration with regards to version history and rolling back, but a slightly different motivation and data point here\n2. Different Connected Drives for read/write - can we already do this? They want to read from one S3 (e.g. upload portal) and then save results to a different S3\n3. Validation Library - they were keen to understand if we had pre-built validations they can use. I know there is some work on this so another data point. They'd love country/region specific ones e.g. an australian postcode has different format to UK one, so some variability here.\n4. Class/Field Name vs Result JSON name - I've heard this from both NAB and ANZ Home Lending. The class names/field names are used by the LLM so must make sense in context to them. However, for downstream systems they often want to use a different set of names e.g \"cust_name_123\". The only way to do this is to write some transformation code/a lookup table. Can we allow customers to choose a field/class name, and also a label (what appears in the JSON results) that can be different from the name?\ncc @Kaustubh (KD) @hannah",

This should already be possible with deployments. You can have different source + destination for upstream and downstream integrations. \n3. We don't have this, but honestly don't know if this is being worked on. Do we have a ticket for this? If not I think we should start formally capturing these requests. \n4. Hmm this one that I remember coming up before. I think this is a flow that we don't really out of the box options for. Post extraction transformations/mapping. @Hamish do you know if a ticket exits for this? If not will also make one here",
