I'm pretty lost on what I'm supposed to do... Based on the blue button \"mark the document as reviewed\", I guess I'm supposed to review the document?\nSome possible solutions:\n1. Update the title to say \"Run result of <run id>, ran at <date/time>\"\n2. Provide some instructions / modal popups with hints like: \"This is the result of your run. Check the result and if anything looks wrong, you can edit it.\".",
