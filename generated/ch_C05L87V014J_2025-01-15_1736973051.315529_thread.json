      "message": "Correct, many of these services do not use k8s as they are straightforward client/server pairs. The ones that are more complicated are things like stats scraping (prometheus/vmagent, loki) which depend on things like service discovery plugins of k8s. We will have to rewrite a bunch of configs here. Another caveat is that some of the stats / dashboards also assume a k8s runtime and may not be very helpful too (ex: queries written in a way that depends on it). This is also true for mesh manager / DM also btw -- which I assume are also not deployed/tested in crafting sandboxes.\n\nI am also inclined to think how much lift is there to standardize crafting deployment with rest of the bundles we publish today.",
