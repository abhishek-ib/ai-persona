Assign one label to every PR in the “Labels” section on the right. You’ll notice these Labels correspond to Release Notes sections\n2. If you want your change to show up in the Release Notes, you must fill in the “Release Notes Text”. Even if you make a change that is “Behavior Change — App” but Release Notes Text is empty, we assume you do not want it to show in our Release Notes\n\nQ/A:\n  Q: What if I have 3 PRs that correspond to one logical customer change?\n  A: Only type in the Release Notes Text for 1 of the PRs, so that the change doesn’t show up as a duplicate in the Release Notes\n\nMore details in Code Style Guide and Pull Request Best Practices:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4uw2Ziudu03dsARAULB2XeJcsL9bEA3ueGT1BzDgik/edit#",
