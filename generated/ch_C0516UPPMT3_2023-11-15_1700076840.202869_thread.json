      "message": "Great kick off session with FinTru today (our first commercial customer!) with a demo led by @Tom Deaney. The team was very engaged and asked a lot of questions. Sharing a few of the questions that they asked below, which gives good insight into feedback and product enhancements.\n\n• \"Do you incur credits when you prototype in build/converse? What if we're iterating on prompts?\"\n    ◦ -> Customers right now gets charged for all development work, but this is something that we'll closely track to see if we need to change pricing strategy\n• \"Why are the answers sometimes different across build and converse?\"\n    ◦ -> We asked for specific examples for this to understand further. \n• \"Can you export out the chat history to share best practices and record what worked well?\"\n    ◦ -> @Varun Jain another use case for having Converse chat export, but likely can be solved with sharing\n• \"Can you pass more information into the class name to increase accuracy?\"\n    ◦ -> @Bastiane another data point on improving classification\n• \"How are confidence scores handled? Do you present the first match for the extraction results? Is there a way to see if there are other candidates of a match?\"\n    ◦ -> @Bastiane follow up potentially on multi-occurence extraction\n• \"Can we support the ability to export the OCR results through API? There are some places where we can leverage the OCR restult\"\n    ◦ -> Another request for this @avi if we want to consider figuring out how to expose in API; @Bastiane mentioned she'd follow up on use case to understand customer need\n• \"Can we have the page numbers of where the data was found?\"\n    ◦ -> Another request for provenance information in API @avi \n• \"When you export to CSV/excel can you see all the fields that you can see in the API?\"\n    ◦ -> Something for us to consider if we wanted app output from UI to be inclusive of fields that you can receive in API (provenance info, confidence scores, etc.)\n• \"Can you cross reference documents to validate?\"\n    ◦ -> @Bastiane use case for cross-reference\nCongrats again @Ben Wood on getting the first commercial customer closed! Can't wait to make them successful.",

On our marketing site, @Bas also wants to introduce a tool to allow someone to OCR a document they upload as a tool to get interest in us.\n\n@Rakesh is it heavy lift to expose the OCR output on an API in AI Hub? FYI, aside from eng lift, we should be careful about exposing the OCR output since it could allow them to use plain GPT to extract multiple fields from the text and pay less.",

Also if they were to only digitize currently and get OCR text -  I dont know if AIHub license will deduct any credits. Credits deduction tied to LLM usage if I understand correctly ?",

      "message": "Got it, that makes sense. We should try to understand the customer need better before we move forward. I fear that experienced devs can use this OCR with plain LLMs to save a lot of AI Hub credits. We'll also need to discuss in depth how to price this OCR endpoint if we create it. Let's pause for now until we understand the customer need and whether it's a blocker.\n\nFor the internal usecase on the marketing site though, perhaps it may be a simpler lift to enable them to use the internal/old API? Let's discuss this separately. cc: @Varun Jain",
