For the postman collection, the `Context` variable should be passed into the header for every endpoint but it's missing from multiple ones:\n• upload file/upload file (commercial)\n• run app with batch\n• get job status\n• ...\nCould we double-check on this and add it to every endpoint? I'm hoping that this will make it easier for customers to use our APIs!\nThank you!",
