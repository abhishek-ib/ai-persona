      "message": "Notes on Cypress from FE guild:\n\n• Having Cypress in CI is helping us catch bugs! Even though it can be frustrating, having Cypress in CI is better than not having it in CI.\n• Making tests more stable and adding more tooling will impede feature development; we need time explicitly set aside for this, rather than just saying it's a priority.\n• When tests are failing on a PR, people need to be more vocal, pinging this channel or <#C053QKXEL3B|> about the failures rather than suffering in silence. That is how we get things fixed and find patterns. The more communication the better.\n• We need to make sure that we don't disincentivize creating new Cypress tests since maintenance is so much higher these days. One thing we'll start requiring is that Cypress tests are written before GA of a feature (as Andy's doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qe8NMI68Pcns7mqYkCxBrnL_s_xRrFc-I97lalO1W6M/edit) lays out).",
