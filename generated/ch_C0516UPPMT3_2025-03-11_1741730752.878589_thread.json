For that, could we look into some UX changes where we\n1. Put the deployments tab before the app runs tab\n2. In app runs, we have a \"Create deployment\" button (colored in showing that it's the primary action) next to \"Run app\" (secondary action) so that we can encourage users to create a deployment",

      "message": "Thanks for sharing! This raises a good point about the _Run app_ CTA. In our research, we consistently heard that this is primarily a testing workflow, so it might make sense to rename it to _Test app_ or something similar. Once the new Apps UI GA's (25.12), we'll be monitoring key metrics in Grafana—specifically, the ratio of apps to deployments and app runs vs. deployment runs.\n\nFor now, we'll keep the designs as they are but remain open to further adjustments if deployment adoption isn’t as high as expected (ideally close to 100% for commercial+ customer apps). Deployment as a tab was placed towards the end since customers typically iterate on their apps first before working on integrations, but we'll adjust course in the future based on more feedback.\n\ncc @Siya for visibility",
