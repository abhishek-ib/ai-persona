One of the sample questions we suggest is “what is the most recent release of AI Hub, and what features are included in it?”\n\nWith today’s updates to 24.34, the bot is still returning that 24.32 from August 19 is the most recent release. It does answer correctly (24.34) in “research mode,” but given that the release numbers and dates are in the document being referenced, it seems like it should be getting this answer right with any model. cc: @avi\n\nI know AI isn’t that good at math so maybe it doesn’t know that August comes _before_ September? :joy:",
