      "message": "For the AI Hub docsbot (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/shared/Instabase/Explore%20AIHub%20Docs), I'm finding that we are not able to answer `What are the new features in the latest AI Hub release?` accurately. The model is picking info from prior releases too (eg: mobile support) while answering the question. When I specify the version, it does much better - `what are the new features in the latest ai hub release version 24.20`.\n\n@Hari @Sławek Biel any idea if we can improve such scenarios from the model side? cc: @jean fyi",

It currently doesn't work well because we don't rewrite the prompt using a custom instructution.\n\n```Please note the following instruction when answering the below question - Answer in a succinct, helpful tone to answer questions about Instabase AI Hub.

The Search tool examines one page a time and all the features look new without the extra context.\n\nWe could improve it by strengthening the prompt like `What's the latest AI Hub release? List its new features. Make sure to only include features from the latest release.` But I don’t know how to improve it in the general case",

I’ll keep thinking about whether there’s something docs can do to help this.",
