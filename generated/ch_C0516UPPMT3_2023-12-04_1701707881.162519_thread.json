      "message": "@hannah I think in this case, seeing as we’re encountering confusion and people are finding the Build alert helpful, it might be good to duplicate the alert system we have in Build. Where we have a modal that explains what’s going on that the user must acknowledge and dismiss when they first open the app. Something like:\n\n> *Default drive has changed*\n> An admin changed the default drive and this conversation can’t be migrated. You can continue interacting with files already in this conversation. To converse with new files, create a new conversation.\n> *[Close]*\nWe can then include the same _About default drives_ / _Changing default drives section_ that displays in the Build alert, if we want to ensure Converse gets the same context.\n\nI think it’s important to convey: the user didn’t do anything wrong/break anything, they can still use the project, and what do if they want to add new files.\n\nUnlike Build, users can continue to interact with the conversation after dismissing the modal, so perhaps we can then either continue showing the modal when a user reopens the conversation, or maintain this messaging with a banner, such as:\n\n> *Default drive changed: Unable to add new files*\n> You can continue interacting with files already in this conversation. To converse with new files, create a new conversation.\nI’ll defer to design on which pattern (repeating modal or one-time modal then banner) makes more sense from a UX perspective.\n\n cc @Siya",
