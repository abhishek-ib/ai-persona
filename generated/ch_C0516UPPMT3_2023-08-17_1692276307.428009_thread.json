      "message": "Hi, i’ve got a use case with Citi at the moment, and i’m not sure of the best way to solve it with our current tooling. I need to get back to Citi pretty quickly on this.\n\nThe below document is quite long, and has lots of different Articles. Each article has a chunk of natural language in it. For All articles I need a list of the investment restrictions extracted. For example ‘Max 5% NAV per issuer’ could be a restriction. Because of the long doc problem I can’t ask ‘Get me all the restrictions from each article out of the whole document’\n\nI thought I could break the document up by the Article Title and then prompt for each article individually. I can’t get this to work well, if I ask ‘In Article 1 list all investment restrictions’ it gets the information from all over the document.\n\nWhat is the best way to approach a problem like this?",
