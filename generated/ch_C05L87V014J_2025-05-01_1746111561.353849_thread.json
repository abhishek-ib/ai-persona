      "message": "Hi all -- PSA from the crafting folks:\n\n`webpack` is leaking a lot of memory in some sandboxes. This is a `webpack` issue, not a crafting issue, but it can cause memory problems in sandboxes, so we should all be aware.\n\nWe have set the max heap size (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/b5bb8164e4b396ff904adc9708a7112a8cb04195/webserver/shared/src/js/webpacked/package.json#L236) for `webpack` already, but it doesn't seem to always be working. If you notice `webpack` is using too much memory (look at `top` to see), or if your sandbox is really super slow (due to swapping) -- restart it, until we can figure out why webpack is doing this:\n\n```cs restart webpack```\nHopefully we can get off `webpack` and onto `vite` at some point anyway; that might also solve the problem.\n\ncc @Serena in case you have any ideas (no action needed)",
