      "message": "I guess it could be like this (framing in terms of derived fields): field 2 is wanted for extraction (e.g. number of bedrooms). Since we want to validate this field, and the best way to do so would be to validate based on the originally extracted data (the JSON here), field 1, we should derive the result of field 2 from field 1 (as opposed to cleaning the initial extraction to filter the result down to the actual data we want to extract).\n\nI guess the key here is that field 1 is not required for a downstream result, its only a checkpoint that we use for validation of another result. Therefore it makes sense to have the option to not expose it in HR or push it downstream, but to allow its existence to validate the actual field we are interested in.\n\nCurrently I can't validate this \"number of bedrooms\" field based on the original extracted result, which is the issue I have.",
