I was thrown by getting a success from the create conversation API but then seeing a failed OCR error in the UI for the conversation I just created. If I ignore the UI, the APIs work as expected. If we plan to make the API available before unifying API and UI behaviour, we’ll need to make it very clear what is happening to prevent the same confusion",
