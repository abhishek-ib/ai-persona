Some of you might be getting some Jira notification in the last hour from me :slightly_smiling_face: We have been pushing the field to submit bug reports through Jira's EPD bug board (https://instabase.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/EPD/boards/305) or Zendesk instead of over Slack channels or DM. I will triage the tickets on EPD bug board every Friday afternoon, so every week at this time is when you'll usually see notification from me, this will become a regular thing :slightly_smiling_face: I encourage you to ask your non-EPD collaborators to send their bug reports & feature requests to the EPD project on Jira (as a bug ticket or new feature ticket), as information on Slack gets lost easily, and it's often hard to track duplicated requests. Thanks!",
