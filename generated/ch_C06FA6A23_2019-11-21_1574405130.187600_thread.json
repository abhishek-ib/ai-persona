We're walking them through a series of experiments to help diagnose but haven't figured out what is the cause out here.\n\n\n• The problem is experienced by site admins\n• There exist certain folders that they retain read access to but have lost CREATE and MODIFY access to.\n• If these folders are duplicated, they have CREATE and MODIFY access on the duplicated copy\n• This problem is being experienced inside of organization owned repos (we haven't checked personal owned repos)\n• This problem is being experienced even if you add FS ACLs explicitly granting access (which shouldn't be necessary since we're on a site-admin account)",
