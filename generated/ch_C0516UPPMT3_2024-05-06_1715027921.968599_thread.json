      "message": "Per the above situation, I did run into one hinderance which did slow me down a bit: The file size of the PDF was over 200MB and converse currently has a 50MB max file size.  While I figure we probably have it on our roadmap to support larger file sizes, I imagine that could prove challenging to implement quickly.  In the meantime, I have a workaround that could be helpful to point users towards.\n\nA quick Google search brought me to this free PDF compression tool from Adobe:\nhttps://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html\nNOTE: open it in an incognito window if you don't have an Adobe license because Okta attempts to automatically sign in, then (at least for me) blocks me saying that I don't have a license for Adobe.  But this tool requires no license nor any login.\n\nPerhaps instead of giving the users a dead end saying that we simply do not support files over 50MB, we can suggest that they try compressing their file to a smaller size.  In my case, a 243MB file compressed down to 42.1MB with no noticeable loss in quality.  The wording could be something like:\n> While we are working on increasing the file sizes that we can support, this free tool from Adobe might be able to help in the meantime:",
