      "message": "Hi all — after discussing with lydia and shaunak, we realized that using mocks and certain test libraries with mypy was creating a lot of pain (and copious use of type: ignore). Therefore, we are addressing this with this PR: https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/10271\n\nWhat this means is that you should have no more need for type: ignore when using the mock library. If a stub or method is missing, please add it.\n\nAlso, if you ever find yourself confused by mypy or finding yourself needing to use type: ignore, please ping <#CKZNSMDSA|> with questions",
