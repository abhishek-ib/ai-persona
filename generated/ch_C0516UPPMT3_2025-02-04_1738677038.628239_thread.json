      "message": "@hannah I agree we do not want to do anything to significantly hinder adoption. we have been given consistent feedback across enterprise customers that they need more governance controls - we received the same question about disabling chat from Fannie Mae yesterday: `Disabling certain components/features like chat and have only normal inference ?`\n\nenterprise customers have a focus on risk minimization, and that requires strong governance controls they can use as they see fit to stay within their organization's security and risk policies. while this may reduce the use of certain features like chat, providing these controls will help accelerate the adoption of AI Hub holistically within enterprises, as it gives them more control to limit their risk burden and helps AI Hub from being blocked all together because they can't disable features that are deemed too risky.\n\nI am looking forward to discussing the granular roles PRD with @jack.robbins, and I am hoping we can include some of this direct customer feedback as we continue to iterate.\ncc @Jason",
