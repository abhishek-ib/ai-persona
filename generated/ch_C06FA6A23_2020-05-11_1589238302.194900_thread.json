      "message": "this seems like a weird bug on instabase.com (http://instabase.com) - or i’m doing something wrong.\n\nI have this folder that contains a Refiner 5 project created with the wizard: https://instabase.com/felicia/my-repo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/ABBYY%20vs%20Find%20Lines/abbyy/\n\nI didn’t upload any files to input, I created the input folder later on and added 4 files to it. I then added another 3 files to it. I ran the `post_install_script.flow` with the settings I wanted, and it shows as processing X out of 7 files. When I open the Refiner program or look at the `out` folder, it only contains ibocr/records referring to the first 4 files?",
