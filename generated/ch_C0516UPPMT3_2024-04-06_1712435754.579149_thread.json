I'd like to dig into this feedback a bit more: \"It's quite tedious to change classes on long documents (takes forever to load) and the splits are really sensitive, which have been leaving off pages of some of the files.\".\n\nFor slowness - is the slowness when you click \"Reclassify\" and it takes a long time to classify the package? (likely because it has so many pages)\n\nFor accuracy - who would be best to talk to about this? Do you have specific classes you've been iterating on? It would be helpful to talk to someone who understands the classes/docs better, since at first glance, it looks mostly correct to me :joy:",
