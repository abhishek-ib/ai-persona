Underwriter sees extraction result, then asks follow up guidelines queries - eg: my claim has a property in Iran? Am I allowed to underwrite it?\n2. OR/AND Underwriter sees extraction result, including an auto-computed field which returns a ~free-form response about whether the submission meets their guidelines? _[likely more challenging]_\nWe're tracking for 1 but 2 seems more like a solid productivity improvement. Would 1 be sufficient to land demos and get things moving? cc: @Bastiane",

      "message": "Right now, The Hartford is doing what AXA tried to do with IB initially. That is - use deep learning to extract ALL the submission data, and then run it through 3 layers of business logic. In order to automate the ranking process, you have to extract all 120 datapoints with high raw accuracy and confidence (unlikely) AND pass all the business logic without failing.\n\nSo the prospect estimated they get about 20% automation out of the submission ranking solution today. And a lot of that comes ONLY from Workers Comp which is the simplest to automate. So really there is barely any business value from this solution.\n\nWhat excites me about ultimate promise of GenAI here — you eliminate the need to extract all the datapoints and build all the business logic layers. Or you can do both.",
