      "message": "Hey team, wanted to share updates from our side! Me and ayesha have focused this week on case management bug fixes for 25.32, the initial release to customers. So we'll be continuing docai work starting tmrw/next week, and Weiming is currently working on build and HR UI. Below, are our estimates for the remaining Parity and V2 items:\n• @pauline.comising Gate flash vs non-flash classification in build based on project settings - 0.5 more day\n• @pauline.comising Create `/flash-extraction` API for build extraction fields - 2 more days\n• @pauline.comising Fix bug where derived clean lines/fields decide whether to use flash or non-flash at compile time - 1.5 more days\n• @pauline.comising Re-extraction - 3 days\n• @ayesha.ali Reasoning fields - 4 days\n• @Weiming Wu Make Build UI support `/flash-extraction` (including calling `/extraction` for refinement lines) - 2 more days\n• @Weiming Wu Make human review and build UI work on PDFs - 3 days (but this is still quite up in the air and subject to change)\nLet us know how this timeline sounds and feel free to share any input on prioritization or anything :slightly_smiling_face:",
