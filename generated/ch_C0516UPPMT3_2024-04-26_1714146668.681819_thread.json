      "message": "Hey, I think this video is a good example to show how small differences in prompts can make a big difference to the extracted outcome [Build, Prod]. In this case, I am trying to fix the 'NONE' entries that appear in the extracted table.\n1. In the original prompt I have quite a few blank entries in the extraction. \n2. Adding 'If no description is given, return 'NONE',' (with a trailing comma) makes the extracted result significantly worse\n3. Replacing the trailing comma with a full stop, makes the response even better than in case 1 (it does more than just replacing empty entries, it also reduces the number of NONE entries)\nThe OCR result seems consistent across dishes, so I have no idea why the 2 remaining NONE entries do not work like the rest of the extracted results. There doesn't appear to be anything special about these entries.\n\n@joshbronko",
