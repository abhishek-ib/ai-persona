      "message": "*Cypress On-Call Updates for July 8-12:*\nWe have mostly moved past persistent failures, which is great because the consistent failure results that we do see are actual bugs! We’re basically only dealing with flakiness on Crafting now. A few other causes are bad test code itself or envs that got messed up / were not correctly setup\n• Flakiness example: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1720811867043189\n• Real bug discovered: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05EQQJGN7L/p1720630631397669\n    ◦ And we managed to get a revert for it merged within a day! We avoided catastrophe on app runs.\nCurrently the top 5 flakey tests are:\n• aihub-refinement-udf.spec.ts @CJ\n• aihub-validation-udf.spec.ts (though it sounds like Elan has a solution for it (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1720819259684699?thread_ts=1720811867.043189&cid=CSY11CK7T)!)\n• converse-app.spec.ts @Aayush\n• aihub-classification.spec.ts @Serena\n• review-manager-dashboard.spec.ts @Udit\nWe should make Jira tickets for each flakey test so that we actually track and can officially dedicate time to investigate and fix them - (for example, I find myself forgetting about previous weeks’ Cypress action items even if I’m tagged…)\nMisc: I made some documentation to hopefully make Cypress less of a pain in the future!\n• https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1720735446465179\n• https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1720568627386209\nBasically, I had a very easy week as on-call. Thanks to everyone (especially previous cypress-on-calls) for making Cypress so much more stable!",
