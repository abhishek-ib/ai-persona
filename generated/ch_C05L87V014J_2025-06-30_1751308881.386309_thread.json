Basically:\n\nv1 => builds from source\nv2 => builds from source + some output from v1\nv3 => builds from source + some output from v2\n...\n\nand so on, until the image is gigantic. I haven't proved this yet, but it seems to explode when webapp is restarting a lot. `prune -a` deletes everything, even if in use. Would've been interesting to see a `docker images` output to see if there were any giant images.\n\nI don't run into this problem myself, so next time I can take a look personally.",
