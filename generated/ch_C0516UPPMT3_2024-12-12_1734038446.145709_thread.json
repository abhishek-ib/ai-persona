Here’s another potentially helpful source: Google Analytics provides data on how often the full-app pages are loaded, such as when users click into an app from Hub (or elsewhere). I’ve pulled data from the past 90 days: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHraD7rfg6IaW9n82TuhxGpMCPtr8m15wVEKA8HW7SI/edit?usp=sharing.\n\nNote that this data doesn’t distinguish between Instabasers and non-Instabasers, as it includes anonymous, non-logged-in visitors. Still, it’s likely correlated with the number of runs each app is getting and could serve as an additional signal.",
