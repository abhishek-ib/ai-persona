The text editor debug functionality is gated (in the backend if not the frontend) the same way all of our UDF functionality is - the user must have permissions to execute UDFs. So this is the same as anywhere in the product we have UDFs\n2. This is not configurable; someone needs to be able to do this and admins are the highest on the food chain. We recommend that not many users be admins, and to use the site permissions and app permissions for functionality other users may need\n3. We have to at least allow users to enumerate other users, or giving another user access to your subspace, for example, would be impossible.\n4. I haven't looked into this before - @Heymian do you know?\n5. I haven't looked into this before - @Heymian do you know?\n6. I'm surprised to hear that, we try do both. Can you send me the specific instances this is the case?\n7. This is something we can make a ticket to change\nHope this helps, and if we need to we can figure out how to prioritize if there are changes needed.",
