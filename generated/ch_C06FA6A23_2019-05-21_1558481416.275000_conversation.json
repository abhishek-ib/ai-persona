If dataset is too large, we may not be able to ship.\n[3] Can we also write concise instructions on how to test various features; and how to validate the output?",

      "message": "So about adding test data and ship to customers - I created some mocked documents for US Markets demo a while ago, at https://www.instabase.com/ib_sales/sales-demo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/us-markets/demo-sample-data/. All the docs here are created by changing some real documents’ employee/employer/user names and ID to Mickey Mouse etc. I hope that is enough but can’t be 100% sure since I’m not an expert on W2/paystubs/bank statements - @Jesika Haria do we have a way to be absolutely sure that all PII are removed? For example, some experts can review them and say they are ok?",
