      "message": "Hi all! We are pushing out a change to enable File Service v2 for all environments, including local environments. We are rolling out the new service incrementally, so for the next few months both the old (thrift) file service and the new (grpc) file service will be needed for all the file system functionality to work correctly.\n*How does this impact you?* \nFor your local environment to continue working, you will now have to run the new grpc-file-service in addition to the thrift-file-service you have already been running.\n_*To run manually*_\n`cd instabase/core-services/file-tservice/grpc-file-service`\n`make build runlocal`  OR `make build-docker run-docker`\n_*Using provisioner*_\n`provisioner.py compile grpc-file-service`\n`provisioner.py start grpc-file-service`\nThe *`all`* flag in provisioner will automatically include the grpc-file-service in the list of services it compiles/starts.\n\n*What is File Service v2?* \nFile Service v2 is a new grpc streaming + golang based implementation of file service that addresses many of the stability and scalability issues with the current file service implementation. The detailed design doc can be found here - File Service Redesign (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CS/pages/871596033/File-service+Redesign)\n\n*Where to go for help?*\nIf you run into a problem or have any questions/concerns/feedback, please reach out to us on the <#C011FHLBN8N|> slack channel.",
