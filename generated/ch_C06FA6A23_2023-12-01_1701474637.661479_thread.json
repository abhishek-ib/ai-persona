      "message": "PSA: Please be careful while updating third-party package versions and backporting them\n\nHi team,\nPlease ensure you follow the correct process while maintaining third-party package versions, especially for our Python services. When updating or adding a 3P dependency, make sure that you update the `requirements.in (http://requirements.in)` or the `pyproject.toml` files *only*. The `requirements.txt` and `poetry.lock` files (if applicable) should only be automatically generated.\nThis becomes even more important when backporting these changes to older releases where services were not using poetry for dependency management.\nAt the moment, there are already a few cases of diverging dependency files in our code - on master as well as older releases - which are not easy to fix.",
