      "message": "@Nathaniel thank you for detailed feedback. cc: @Vishnu @lydia\n• For those instances where the name and prompt aren't great, can you provide some example docs and prompts that you tried? We are trying to collect these with every ounce of feedback that we get so feedback becomes more actionable. \n• I think these features will always carry the inherent risk that it could be worse something but our goal is have the odds in our favor. \n    ◦ Def will be considering prompt history on our roadmap (cc: @hannah)\n• This is an interesting one and one that I had questions about in the past. The name being the model input is great for the beginner - a user who wants to see value and feedback immediately. However it may not be the most helpful choice for a more advanced use case. Do you have examples of naming conventions that you would like to have? \n    ◦ It sounds like you are looking for a model input name and then a downstream systems name \n• We don't have hidden fields today but I would like to understand the use case here more. What happens in review when you have an issue on a field that depends on a hidden field -- how does this affect the source tracking/linage?",
