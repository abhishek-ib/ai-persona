      "message": "Hi, I'm noticing that sometimes even when my sandbox starts successfully, if I restart a service (in my case `core-platform`) it can throw another aws creds error. As of rn I am suspending & resuming my crafting sandbox which is time consuming. I want to check if there is an easier workaround when it is just 1 service that is running into these errors. Is there a terminal command  or something that I can run to refresh the credentials (like `ecr-login`)?\n\nI know for `api-server` I can just cd into `webserver/api-server` and run `make clean build runlocal` , can I do something similar for `core-platform`?\n\n401 unauthorized error:\n```#6 [internal] load metadata for 549230430157.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/instabase-build/go:1.24.4\n#6 ERROR: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://549230430157.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v2/instabase-build/go/manifests/1.24.4: 401 Unauthorized```",
