      "message": "Just received an interesting request from NM and honestly I'm not even sure where to post it, so this message might make it to a few larger channels!  After going through the golden creation process, the NM team realized two main things:\n\n1. They ask a lot of information on their documents that they really don't care about\n2. There is a major opportunity to make a better document format for anything that will be OCR'd in the future\n\nBased on these two findings, they're going to re-think all of their documents at NM, and eventually want to redesign them to be more OCR friendly.  They've asked _US_ if we have any best practices on what makes an ideal document for running through Instabase.  Do we have anything like that?",
