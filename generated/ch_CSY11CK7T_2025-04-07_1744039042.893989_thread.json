      "message": ":cypress-spin: *Cypress on-call summary for 3/31-4/4*:cypress-spin: \n1. Updated `view-home-page`  to use the newly created user for Cy CI, this should help with flakiness.\n2. Fixed `ground-truth-crud`  which was broken by an api change. A data point to push for running cypress on backend PRs!\n3. `aihub-templates` and `build-project-crud` were broken due to a UI change, but our Cy CI logic for determining which tests are relevant did not pick up these tests to run on the UI change PR. \n    a. (The “open project” button was changed to link to workspaces instead of directly to the first build project) ideally we should update dependencies.test to catch changes to the home page since you have to start from the home page to open a build project\n4. `field-editor` was flaky due to model result fluctuation, I’ve made the regex check more lenient to catch multiple valid results\n5. Removing flow run broke an import which blocked Cy CI. Removing the import fixed this. The flakiness of Cy CI makes it harder to determine what are actual issues that need to be fixed :cry: \nHopefully this keeps Cypress in a stable and useful state!",
