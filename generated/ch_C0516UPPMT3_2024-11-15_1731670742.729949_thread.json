We checked the DB for that doc and did not find it.

      "message": "Hi @margaret.tomaszczuk\nThanks for confirming - so on further digging we found the reason why you were seeing this before and this week you are not seeing this doc /result anymore.\nSo basically last week when debugging queries and issues reported from Hamish - found a user had mounted entire GDrive with personal +shared drives  - that was polluting the index space (same drives essentially mounted multiple times). So we removed that from indexing.\n\nThat one had some of the newer docs indexed including this one. (workspace was `clemens-demo` and that mount is only included for all org admins as they are all part of every workspace automatically).\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0516UPPMT3/p1731412119881069?thread_ts=1731338918.137959&cid=C0516UPPMT3\n\nNow, since I cleaned that up last week, some of documents that were indexed there are no longer appearing in search result as we disabled that mount from indexing.\nWe were able to confirm this by searching the specific doc URL and tracing to this workspace mount that we disabled.",
