This means that for a customer who uses IB drive, there is no way for them to delete data from the system unless they reach out to us.\n\nWe should add this to the backlog (I'll create a ticket cc: @andy) and perhaps we can use the mechanism that @Cheryl Zhou is working on for being able to remove app runs on unmount.",
