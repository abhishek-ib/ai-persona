For fields we only show the single field in the results table if its being edited. But for validations we don’t always have a full panel for the editing state so we just use whichever validation rule is selected (the one with the border around it)",

So if you’re editing a field and then switch to validation tab, the editing field is preserved when you switch back. That’s also why you’re seeing the validation rule continue to be selected",
