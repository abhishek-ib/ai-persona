      "message": ":cypress-spin: We turned on Cypress CI merge blocking on May 8, and we said that we’d review our decision after a month, so here’s the update!\n\n:meow_code: Over the past month, we’ve heard this feedback from our frontend engineering team\n• We have found Cypress useful for catching bugs (example (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05EQQJGN7L/p1717774752855129)), race conditions (example (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58593)), and performance issues (example (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C03UZR5P1S6/p1718061837835019)).\n• For most of our tests, when we see a failure, we believe that there really may be something wrong (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1717779299882749)!\n• We retry Cypress CI a couple times, but we don’t actively spend a lot of time debugging Cypress tests (discussion (https://github.com/instabase/frontend-docs/blob/master/guild-agenda.md#june-12-2024)).\n:hourglass_flowing_sand:The main concern is that feature development is slower since we need to run Cypress CI several times to avoid flaky failures / timeouts. We are actively addressing this in several ways.\n• @CJ is working on running only failed tests from the previous CI run if there have been no changes to the branch since the last run.\n• @sean.donohoe set up a new crafting-cyp environment, and @CJ is working on changing the Cypress CI jobs to run on that environment. With separate environments for crafting dev setups and Cypress CI runs, we think the likelihood of timeouts will decrease.\n• @Xindi Xu is working on creating new users/orgs for each test run (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1718382454284409) to maintain independent state\n• Also, I outlined what to do if Cypress fails on your PR here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YIkXbxu7NE9FD5SQlJs5qj114LD-6yK__-qMA3sWis/edit?pli=1#heading=h.8zxs1j4db66e) (see screenshot as well). Please use the new <!subteam^S07855GV3GV> tag to ask for help in this channel if necessary!\n:speaker: Our current decision is to continue with Cypress CI as merge blocking since we’ve made a lot of progress on Cypress test stability and have action items for further improving test stability.",
