      "message": ":cypress-spin: Cypress on-call summary\nThis week, Cypress test failures helped us identify these bugs:\n1. `loginless-sample-results.spec.ts` failed on Tuesday because the `/deployed/solution` API endpoint uses the feature flags system incorrectly (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1742245349800819)):\n    a. The feature flag system would blindly check `request.current_user.email.endswith` but the guest user's email field is set to `None` . @Paul H fixed it. Thank you :raised_hands: \n    b. It overwrites the username from `guest` to `aihub_guest`, so the feature flag system thinks that it's an org context so it tries to fetch the org to check the tier and fails. I fixed it!\n2. `loginless-sample-results.spec.ts` failed again on Wednesday because the app UI was changed completely (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1742411976524049)). @danny.lan fixed one test and skipped the other test. @Paul H is looking into updating the test. Thank you both! :raised_hands: \n3. Since Thursday, the billing-related env vars across cypress-cyp, aihub-sandbox, and aihub-uat are mysteriously set to incorrect values or empty strings (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C052YKRTJP5/p1742488810943309)). We can no longer create new users so all Cypress CI failed and `sign-up` test failed in aihub-sandbox and aihub-UAT. We haven't root-caused why these env vars were gone. But I patched the environments so Cypress tests shouldn't be blocked. \n4. `build-project-crud` and `aihub-templates` failed due to UI updates (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1742505572768949)).  @Serena root caused it and @Weiming Wu fixed it! Thank you both :raised_hands: \n5. `version-history` failed because sometimes the app can end up in a bad initial state (thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1742505746320619)). @Serena root caused it and @Paul H fixed it!
