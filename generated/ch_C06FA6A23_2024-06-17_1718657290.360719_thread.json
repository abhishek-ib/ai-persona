      "message": "Hi all, I wanted to bring up a topic for discussion regarding future support plans. Currently, NWM is encountering an issue (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C011FHLBN8N/p1718647632109639?thread_ts=1718216338.780199&cid=C011FHLBN8N) with SAML in the 24.04 upgrade, which disallowed usernames with uppercase letters. Although the team is working on a prospective fix, we are unable to test it internally due to the lack of a sandbox environment for testing SAML issues. Is there a specific reason we donâ€™t have this capability, and are there any plans to enable internal testing for SAML in the future? Thank you!\n\ncc: @Dale DeLoy",
