I just wanted to understand what all I should keep in mind from a platform point of view.\n\n1. Their current on prem version is 21.04\n2. The SaaS version would be 23.01\n3. The solutions have been delivered as ibflowbin\n4. We are on Flow v2\n5. The Process files uses both PDF and OCR service (Abby and Marx)\n6. We may have preflow and postflow UDFs\n7. The file IO operations are using clients.ibfile\n8. Provenance is done using WordPolyInputColMapper object\n9. The documents could range from 100 - 2000 pages\nHow many of these won't be supported in 23.01 and what are the alternatives for the same?\n\ncc: @Veera @amber @BG @Gilbert Solorzano",
