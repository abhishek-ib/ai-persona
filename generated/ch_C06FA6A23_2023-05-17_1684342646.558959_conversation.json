They are not really a direct competitor (I view them more like Bard, GPT -- model providers that we can potentially use), but since they recently release very large context window support we'd like to know where they are.\n\nThis year, the document understanding space will be very crowded and noisy -- you will likely see lots players offer similar capabilities, claiming they can do similar things as we do. Our goal here is to always stay ahead and keep moving :muscle: As we continue to make effort on model development, keep in mind that the suite of apps Instabase provides to our customers in automating document processing has always been our strong advantage over any model providers -- the workflow, the ability to mix heuristic and different types of models, validation, and human review to name a few. To stay ahead, every part of our platform needs to keep moving to improve usability and / or capability, it's a collective effort :slightly_smiling_face:",
