      "message": "hello, a prospect, Kering, mentioned that it would be super helpfull to have an “Field Import” button in Build, where they can upload for example a .json file with all fields they have automatically created. Then the import will create blank fields with only the Field names from the import file.\n\nThey are asking, because they have a Use Case with around 1000 fields. So they dont want to manually create each field.<\n\ncc: @Sanch",

From there, I'd turn to a PM to see if they would support implementing that feature into the platform.  But it sounds like this potential deal could drive a bit more urgency on implementing this feature.",
