Are we planning to deprecate it?\n\nA client needs to check Instabase's internal health for disaster recovery decisions. They used the API, but 'test_multipart_upload' test case keeps failing. However, all tests pass when run through the APP.\n\nI tried on dogfood. Running it via the API, I also get 'test_multipart_upload' failed. I can't run via the app; it shows '404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually, please check your spelling and try again.\n\nfrom clients:\n\n`Running through the Admin Diagnostics app via the UI, all 11 tests are shown to be passing.`\n`I can also confirm the 1 failed test is persistent for the multi part uploads via the API.`\n`Do you know what the roadmap is for these diagnostics APIs, when will they be promoted out of preview status?`\n`Hi, Jet. Main reason of usage for this API - looking for the way to check instabase internal health before making a decision for DR. All infrastructure components already covered, but any proposals how to get instabase health status via existing API's are appreciated.`",
