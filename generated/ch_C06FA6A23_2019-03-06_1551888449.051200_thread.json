      "message": "Hey all - think I found a bug in Review OCR? Or is this the expected behavior?\nWas creating a flow that does 1) Process Files -> 2) Apply UDF to fix some orc-ed text in the `text` field in an ibocr file. Opened Apply UDF’s output in Refiner & everything looked normal (content became what I changed). But when I opened Apply UDF’s output in Review OCR, the `View Text` result is something else - it is the original output of Process Files.\n\nI put the buggy files in\nhttps://www.instabase.com/kerry/my-repo/fs/Instabase%20Drive/bugs/apply_udf_ocr_text/\nIf you click on an ibocr file to view in Review OCR, you’ll see the scanned text.\nIf you right click an ibocr to open it in Refiner, you’ll see the content in INPUT_COL is `hello` which is the value in the `text` field in the ibocr.",

If that’s the case then you might need to change the words as well in the IBOCR to get it to show up",
