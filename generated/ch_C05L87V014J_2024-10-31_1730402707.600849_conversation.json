      "message": ":information_source: *Feature Requests and Bugs* :information_source:\n<!here>\n\nWe have a new Jira project for reporting bugs, improvements and feature requests!\n\nGoing forward people should create tickets under the Crafting (https://instabase.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CRAFT/issues?jql=project%20%3D%20%22CRAFT%22%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC) Jira project. This was added with the goal of making bug reporting and improvement tracking simpler than it is today -- I know many messages in this channel go unacknowledged and/or unresolved, and has lead to a frustrating experience using crafting. We are especially looking to reduce the number of instances where people are blocked for an unacceptable amount of time, while also making it easier to confidently identify and implement bug fixes/improvements!\n\nI will be monitoring this project very closely and looking to make improvements which could help make the reporting process as trivial as possible -- if you feel your ticket has gone un-noticed for more than a day please tag myself in this channel and I will take a look!\n\nWhile we want to encourage using Jira as much as possible, please remember that we have a support appointment schedule (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C05L87V014J/p1714153366413389) for problems which require a more hands-on approach :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThank you very much to everyone who has been using and improving the platform over the past year, it's grown significantly over that period of time and I'm very excited to see where we can take it next :tada:\n\nFinally, a particularly big shout out to @mfichman, who has independently taken on a lot of crafting items over the past several weeks and has been an invaluable resource for improving the platform for everyone :heart_hands: :pray:",
