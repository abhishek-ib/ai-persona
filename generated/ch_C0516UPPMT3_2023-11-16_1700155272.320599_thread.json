They just want the deskewed docs after we process them to correctly overlay provenance info.\n\nFor marketing, we can look into an internal-only solution without opening the can of worms to expose this externally.",

We need to think through how to expose provenance and the deskewed docs cleanly here for these customers.\n\nAnother interesting insight was that these customers (at least Fintru) were basically recreating the human review in their own ops tooling. I wonder if we should spend more time to convince them that their ops team should just use AI Hub human review :slightly_smiling_face: cc: @Eric Han @andy",
