We're going to try something new - there will be anew question candidates have to answer when submitting their resumes asking them to describe a recent React component they built and the technical challenges they faced. This will hopefully screen for both intent and for react knowledge a little better.",

Just speaking from my own experience applying to jobs before joining IB, I personally didn't really bother applying if the initial application felt like it required too much upfront time investment. Especially since candidates are so used to resum√© rejections I feel like it might be too much to expect them to submit a response for that question.",
