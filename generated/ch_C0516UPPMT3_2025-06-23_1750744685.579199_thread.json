      "message": "Hi Team, we have feedback received from Legent for integration of url to chatbot service. When a specific link it added only the home page or HTML page of that specific link is captured and converted to PDF.\nUser have tried with Notebook LM which allows the submission of webpage, which is processing the data completely including sub-pages. Below is the feedback from the user. Any insights to address this is much appreciated.\n\n```Dear Instabase Support Team,\nI hope this message finds you well.\nI would like to provide some feedback regarding the integration of URLs in the chatbot concerning source files. I have noticed that when a URL is added, only the homepage or the HTML page of that specific link is captured and converted into a PDF, which serves as the basic information (ground truth). \nIn comparison, when using Notebook LM, it allows for the submission of a webpage, which is then fully processed as a data file (including all sub pages). I believe it would be beneficial for Instabase to explore how Notebook LM handles this feature, as it could enhance the functionality of your platform.\nThank you for considering this suggestion. I look forward to your response.```\nZD : https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/9819",
