This was after attempting to fix the monaco bugs by repulling from master and recompiling and restarting webapp, apps-server, and server-nginx.\n\nSince then I've tried repulling from master, rebuilding and re-running all of the lite services, and logging in from an incognito tab but still run into the error screen :disappointed: .",
