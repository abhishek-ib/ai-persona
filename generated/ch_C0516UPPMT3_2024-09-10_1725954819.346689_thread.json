This kind of mistakes are inherent to how we do things.\n\nWhen you search the vector store for a thing like “what is the most recent release of AI Hub” every chunk that talks about a release is equally relevant, the text doesn’t contain anything to anchor to like “this is the newest release” so it’s totally possible that a chunk from the first page doesn’t make the cut by a chance.",

When looking at multiple chunks it should be easy for the model to see which chunks are more recent and therefore more relevant.
