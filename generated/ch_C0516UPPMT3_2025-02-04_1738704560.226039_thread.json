      "message": "Hi team, I've been playing around with the new UI and have a few pieces of initial feedback:\n1. I do like the Project - App - Deployment nav bar at the top. It makes switching between apps and projects much easier. It also helps visualize these concepts for users who often have a hard time understanding everything\n2. I do miss the settings button at the top. It might just be because I'm used to it at this point, but the new arrow dropdown next to project name for accessing settings doesn't seem as intuitive to me.\n3. I did notice that \"Mark run as reviewed\" button is gone in the new UI. I don't get any indication that the changes that I've made in the human review have been saved. The only option out of this page is to go back, and I see that this saves the changes values when I come back, but it feels wrong to me.\n4. I know that we got rid of \"Mark document as reviewed\" and introduced the blue/gray dots to indicate whether a document has been clicked on. But for documents that failed validations, there's no way to get rid of the red x's. If I look at a document with failed validations, I expect to be able to get rid of them whether through confirming the flagged values or altering them. The red x's draw more attention than the gray dots on the left hand panel, so I never feel like I'm done reviewing these docs.\n5. What's the reason for aligning \"Workspaces\" and \"Hub\" the way they are aligned? It's not central and the new alignment seems awkward.",

My thinking here is that the way we pitch validations to companies today centers around catching errors made by AI and having a human verify it. Once a human verifies it by either confirming or denying its accuracy, then I feel like the validation rule has finished its job and should disappear? Or have its status changed the \"Checked\" or something along those lines. Again, it could just be me :sweat_smile:",
