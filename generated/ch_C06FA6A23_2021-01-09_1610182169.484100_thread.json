      "message": "Hey, i did think about service owners briefly, and ended up leaving it off. I worry that “dividing” up ownership at the service level might encourage bad practices such as the loose creation of new services wherever there’s a new “feature”. We need to rethink our microservice division, because it is getting out of hand. I imagine that we should be able to unify more of them based on resourcing constraints rather than just functionality, in which case, there’ll be more shared ownership as many teams will work within the service.",
