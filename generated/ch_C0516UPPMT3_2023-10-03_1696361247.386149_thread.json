To join *\"Instabase-GTM\"* org on https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/ \n    a. Reach out to <#C05BJCNKZAM|> to get an email invite to join the org\n    b. You will receive an email invite at the following alias: *<first.last>+aihubGTM@instabase.com* or *<first>+aihubGTM@instabase.com* depending on how your IB email is set up\n2. As an example, for <mailto:bastiane.huang@instabase.com|@Bastiane>: \n    a. IB email: <mailto:Bastiane.huang@instabase.com|Bastiane.huang@instabase.com>\n    b. Email invite: <mailto:bastiane.huang+aihubgtm@instabase.com|bastiane.huang+aihubgtm@instabase.com> \n3. Once your account is created, you’ll be ready for testing on https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/\nThe official GA date of AI Hub Commercial is *Oct 10*. If you need to demo AI Hub Commercial features ahead of GA, please add demo dates to Growth Sales | Signal Map (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QI-ueRi9J7XvnGDYkbZ1m9TLuJ8klaS6cE_-3OQNQrA/edit#gid=0) (tag or slack <mailto:bastiane.huang@instabase.com|@Bastiane>) so we can avoid any software update at that time. Meanwhile, if you have any feedback please create EPD tickets (select “new feature” as the issue type and “commercial” as label), so that we can centralize feedback on this board (https://instabase.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/EPD/boards/308?quickFilter=700) and reduce duplicity. Any other questions, please feel free to post in <#C0516UPPMT3|> Slack channel.",

We can make you a new account under the email alias above that can be added into the org. Once in the org, you will be able to access all commercial features. If you already have access to the commercial features in this environment, then no need to create another account.",
