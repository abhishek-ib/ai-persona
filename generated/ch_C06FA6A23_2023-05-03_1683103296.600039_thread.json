S*o maybe this is expected behaviour*, but in the original screenshot it showed “No subspaces to view” because I had no public space in my account, which aligns to what you are saying but still discloses the fact that “saikat_biswas” is an user to individuals on the public web. Maybe this is not a big deal at all, haha.\n\nAs for the above two screenshots where I faced two different responses when I was  accessing https://instabase.com/admin. After taking another look at them it seems it was a miss on my part for the one erroring out - I had used - https://instabase.com/admin/ (with a forward slash in the end), that seems to be the reason :sweat_smile:, @karen.
