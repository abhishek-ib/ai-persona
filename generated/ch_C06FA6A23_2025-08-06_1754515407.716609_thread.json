      "message": "Hi all, I'm having trouble with triggering re-extraction after changing the class label in human review. Seeing an \"Access Denied\" error which seems to happen when `run_binary_async` is called in `/change-classification-label`.\n\nI looked into it, it's happening in the `can_execute_via_api` method in `FlowPerms`.  It's being called in this set of lines:\nhttps://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/shared-utils/py-utils/flow-handler/src/py/instabase/flow_handler/flow_handler.py#L296-L308\nIt seems that the changes made in https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/72881/files broke an existing flow cc @Xindi Xu\n\nI'm not super familiar with how the existing code was supposed to work, can you take a look?",
