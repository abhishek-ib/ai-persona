Upon further investigation, I realized that this was already fixed by @prateek.tenkale in PR #73959 (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/73959).\n\nAfter todayâ€™s upgrade, Nationwide is now on *V25.36.1*. I tested the same scenario on this version, and it is working as expected (video attached for reference).\n\nI see that the patch has also been added to 25.34 in PR #74540 (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/74540). It should work for customers on 25.34 as well",
