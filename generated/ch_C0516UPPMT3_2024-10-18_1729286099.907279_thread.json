      "message": "Build - Validations UI feedback and potential bug\n• The save and cancel buttons here both feel greyed out [see SS1], but it wasn't clear if/what it needed me to finish doing (pressing return didn't do anything).  Eventually I tried clicking on the \"greyed out\" save button and it turns out that's just its normal color.\n• I can't seem to recreate it now, but at first it was acting like it'd only let me add 2 rules in the `Apply to all` group.  After I added a class confidence rule and field confidence rule, the `Add rule` button was gone, even through a page refresh.  However, once I tried deleting the class confidence rule, the button returned and it let me add an OCR confidence rule [as can be seen in SS1].  Then after that was added, I now had the button to add back the class confidence rule, leading to all 3 as intended.",
