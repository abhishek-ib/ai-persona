Renre is now asking to see this data - is there any data that we can share on this @lydia @Kaustubh (KD)? cc: @Tom @Orlando @Akshay",

We last benchmarked Anthropic ~ 8 months ago, and considering their recent model releases, that is probably pretty outdated.\n\nI can work with the model dev team to prioritize this soon. Let me chat with @Nikolaos Kofinas to get a sense of effort.\n\nI thought a big part of why we only offer OpenAI is also the privacy terms and the quota/rate limits we've negotiated.\n\nThere may also be differences in API features that prevent us from seamlessly switching (I'll circle back on this).",
