      "message": "*Prompt Optimisation Feedback*\nHey, here's some feedback mainly around UX that I noticed with this feature:\n1. I often feel like no changes get made when I click the optimise button (or at least I'm struggling to see how my prompt has changed)\n    a. Can we hide the button unless there is a somewhat meaningful suggestion available e.g. more than 4 words changed? \n    b. I realise this would mean potentially a lot of LLM calls though (maybe just do after run is hit?)\n2. It's unclear how the prompt has been altered\n    a. I'd suggest maybe greying out the additions or some visual to show\n3. A better way to compare new prompt results to old results would be great\n    a. Currently I would just hit undo, then hit enhance, then undo etc to swap between the options and see the changes",
