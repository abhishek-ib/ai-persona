Wouldn’t that homogenize developer execution environment and dramatically simplify developer machine setup? Are there any downsides to this?\n\nAnother question worth getting thoughts on… would it make sense for us to make our Makefiles linux-friendly (I think some of the OSX Docker networking has resulted in OSX specific makefiles..) and considering a model in which we have EC2 build boxes?",
