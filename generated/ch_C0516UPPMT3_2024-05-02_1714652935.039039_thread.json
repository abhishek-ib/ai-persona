      "message": "A page 1 result is actually pretty good, especially on fairly generic words like AI and Hub (also note that domains like Google, Microsoft and many others with much higher domain authority have pages and products called “AI Hub”). I do agree with Travis that having a domain name that is simpler and aligned would improve things. However, since there is little other content (eg blogs, pillar pages,  videos etc) on the product page, there is not much we can do to support the product page directly. Instead we push this content on Instabase.com (http://Instabase.com) with heavy linking to ai hub. Additional PR leads to more backlinks to the product page and would further boost its rank.",
