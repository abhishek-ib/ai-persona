There is a `class AppView` in both files have a `/projects/apps`  endpoint. It seems `projects.py` one are prefixed with `/api/v2/zero-shot-idp` whilst the `aihub_build.py`  ones are prefixed with `/api/v2/aihub/build` . I had a few questions about this:\n1. Why do we have two separate endpoints for the same Apps CRUD operations?\n2. Why are some Apps functionality split between the two endpoints?\ncc @Gauti",
