Before I merge this I wanted to let everyone know that this will require a one time effort for each developer to update their local. The PR is here: https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/18600 If anyone has any feedback please let me know otherwise I’ll be merging this in later today and you will need to spend a few minutes following the instructions to update your local.
