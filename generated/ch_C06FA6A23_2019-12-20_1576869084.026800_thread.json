They want us to meet with them periodically to receive feedback but it has to be in “pilot” with them and if we decide to move production *all SLA’s for the container do not apply*. They are sending me a text file that we need to replace with the existing license terms in the container… which I’ll send to the infra team @Aaron Tami that we need to replace in the containers we ship (its a manual replacement) we have to send a screenshot of us replacing it with the new terms.\n\nOnce we send the email, *that is all they need*, we are good to go for deployment with customers as soon as we send the screenshot with the new terms!\n\nWe are good to go with Microsoft OCR on prem with customers!!!",
