      "message": "@Clemens and I met with the Swiss Re CTO, Chief Data Officer, Global Head of Cloud Infrastructure and CIO yesterday during an EBC. We shared a demo of AI Hub and they were incredibly impressed with the product. We heard a lot of \"wow, this is amazing\", \"can't believe you can actually solve use cases like this\" and \"this is exactly what we're looking to solve\".  To top it off, the CTO at the end of the meeting (who was pivotal to turn into an IB supporter) said \"This is definitely a follow-up. Very impressive.\"\n\nTheir positive feedback was particularly meaningful as we first started engaging with Swiss Re >3 years ago and have been very close to signing two deals with them in the past after months-long engagements/numerous povs, etc. The entire team present was absolutely blown away by how much our product has changed over the last 3 years (since what they called \"program synthesis\" :joy:).\n\nThey recognize how unique it is for a company to be innovating at the pace that we are and they know that by adopting IB, we will provide them with a direct conduit to innovation - something priceless for a company like Swiss Re.\n\nIncredible job everyone - hopefully this will be the time we finally convert them. :rocket:",
