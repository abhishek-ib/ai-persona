In the meantime, I think we'll continue to leverage the existing API endpoints if they are potential blockers for deals we're pursuing, but won't actively push them to these docs. @jack.robbins let me know if I can help out with this",

However, we should be cautious about customers integrating them into critical processes with new AI Hub launches.
