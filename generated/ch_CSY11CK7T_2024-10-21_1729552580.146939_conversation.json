      "message": "Cypress wrap from last week (Oct 14 - Oct 18th):\n• General issues:\n    ◦ Metronome commercial accounts were not using the correct license, causing billing errors in our tests with the error `Spend limit exceeded`. Resolution: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1729276738795049?thread_ts=1729035855.216129&cid=CSY11CK7T\n    ◦ Failing to spin up Crafting sandboxes due to local dev changes. Fix is on master, you need to delete and re-run your CI action: https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C06FA6A23/p1729522259143729?thread_ts=1729262929.832159&cid=C06FA6A23\n    ◦ The Github action no longer reports the Cypress URL when the tests fails. Have we changed something recently? Thread (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1729537498525489).\n• Fixes\n    ◦ Big props to Jessica, Liam, Serena and Xindi for investigating and fixing numerous Cypress issues. You guys are leading the way on making the tests green again.\n• Current state\n    ◦ Cypress is still mostly red :cry: not because of a single test but a collection of semi-failing tests.\nSwitching <!subteam^S07855GV3GV> to @Udit",
