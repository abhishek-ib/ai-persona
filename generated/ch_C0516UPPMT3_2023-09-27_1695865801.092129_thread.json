      "message": "Thanks @Lalit. Think the last concern on this thread here is the fact that when you create the app on Build, and then run the same document through, it doesn't recognize there is a table to extract from. Seems to be a consistent problem with table extraction in Build - works when you're editing the app, but not when you run docs through. Posted a new ticket below with a slightly different problem (ran through different docs and it came back with highly inconsistent results).\n\nFor context - this is for a potential customer that just needs to extract the material lists & \"Line Number\" off of these and export as Excel. If we can fix the table extraction for them there's a good chance they buy. Line Number works well.",
