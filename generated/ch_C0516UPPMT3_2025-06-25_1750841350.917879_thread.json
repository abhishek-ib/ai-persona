The purpose of the chatbot is to provide general information to employees about our organization.\n\nWe have uploaded various data sources, including the annual reports, the general terms and conditions, and the pricing list. Additionally, we would like to load the entire website into the chatbot. However, we are encountering difficulties with this last aspect, as it appears we can only upload it page by page, which is very time-consuming.\n\nTherefore my development request to upload complete websites, including of subpages, as is possible in LM Notebook.```",
