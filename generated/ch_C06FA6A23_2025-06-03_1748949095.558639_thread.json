Dear sweet baby cthulu, I hope it works. :lolcry: \n2. So, there's a lot of really irritating stuff about Linux, and it turns out, the sysconf parameter `SC_NL_ARGMAX` just might be one of them. :upside_down_face: \nI remembered seeing the option to query sysconf parameters via Python's `os.sysconf()` function, but I didn't know the names to pass it for sure - so `os.sysconf_names` to the rescue.\nThat yields a list of 130+ parameters, but the interesting ones were:\n```[...]\n  \"SC_ARG_MAX\": 0,\n[...]\n  \"SC_NL_ARGMAX\": 119,\n[...]```\nSeemed odd that `SC_ARG_MAX` is effectively 'unlimited', but I hadn't seen the `SC_NL_ARGMAX` one in a hot minute.\n\nCompliments of the ever helpful (lulz) GNU docs on Output Conversion Syntax (https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_182.html):\n>  An optional specification of the parameter used for this format. Normally the parameters to the `printf` function are assigned to the formats in the order of appearance in the format string. But in some situations (such as message translation) this is not desirable and this extension allows an explicit parameter to be specified. The param-no part of the format must be an integer in the range of 1 to the maximum number of arguments present to the function call. Some implementations limit this number to a certainly upper bound. The exact limit can be retrieved by the following constant.\n> Macro: *NL_ARGMAX*\n>  The value of `ARGMAX` is the maximum value allowed for the specification of an positional parameter in a `printf` call. The actual value in effect at runtime can be retrieved by using `sysconf` using the `_SC_NL_ARGMAX` parameter see section Definition of  (https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_636.html#SEC647)`sysconf`.

For `refiner-utils`, the only headroom we had prior to the Otel change was a whopping *`1,526` bytes.* :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: \n\nAnd at the average path length of ~242 bytes (on my crafting box anyway), that meant we could add between 4 and 6 new dependency packages, direct or indirect, before it would tip over.",
