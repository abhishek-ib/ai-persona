It's looking for a custom background, not finding one, so it should be falling back to the default and loading desktop-background.jpg - do you have that in your network requests?\n\nCan you explain what you mean when you say you can't click on the all apps button? Is the overlay not working? Can you try hard refreshing maybe, cmd+shift+r? Everything is working fine for me.",

I did a hard refresh which is still showing the same result.\n\nI see two fetches for background in network, both seem to be the same (image attached).\n\nWhen I click the apps button, nothing happens. Much like if there was nothing attached to it.\n\nFor custom background, I thought that might be the issue but I don’t have anything in there and the button is disabled.",
