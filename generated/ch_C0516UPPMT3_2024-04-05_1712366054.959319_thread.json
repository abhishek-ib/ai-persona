      "message": "Hi there, I have some difficulties with Validation prompts - it is not intuitive to me what is happening. I have an excel sheet, from which I have extracted a List of Countries. They are all USA, except one, which I labeled \"Iran\". I set up the validation prompt as \"If Country is equal to USA, return Pass. If unequal to USA, return Fail\". I was hoping it would flag the Iran entry, but it doesnt. It just says \"Fail\", and then I have to go find out why. Is that as expected? Should I set up my validation prompt differently? Many thanks for your help! Screenshot below.",
