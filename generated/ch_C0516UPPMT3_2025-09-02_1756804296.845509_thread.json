This mismatch is causing issues:\n• The comparison view becomes difficult to read and interpret.\n• The *accuracy figures are unclear* because the list extraction format doesn’t align well with the ground truth table structure.\n:hammer_and_wrench: *Details:*\n• Config: `list of objects`\n• Issue: Format inconsistency between extracted output (JSON list of objects) and ground truth table format.\n• Impact: Accuracy analysis is misleading due to structural mismatch.\nhttps://pg.aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/8cb0b5a1-bafc-40ed-80de-e0f51e0ebbf9/accuracy/221\nCC @Raushan Kumar Pandey @Swathy N @Nithin",
