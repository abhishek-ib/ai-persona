My prompt is to create a table of revenue across these reports between 2018 and 2023. But it just craps out on me without telling me why. This is Prod. Is there something unstable with Prod at the moment, or can it simply not handle the length of these docs (in this case we need a clearer error message). See screenshot. Docs are here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XPd8Tt1XBHVA0mC_pEdaMz3ZPWXObJ7S?usp=sharing) in case useful.",

That might actually be more of a feature request actually - especially in Multistep and longer prompts it is quite unpredictable whether the prompt will return a table, bullet list, a paragraph, full json etc. It could be interesting to combine some features of Build (eg Clean) into Converse. Instead of just the download button, it could say reformat or refine, and allow you to prompt the response again to put something in a pretty table or bulletize a paragraph",
