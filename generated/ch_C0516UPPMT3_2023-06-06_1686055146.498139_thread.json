      "message": "*Sharing a couple of feedback items from observing a friend play around with our product. These are worth considering to make the experience simpler. Priorities are based on how confusing they found it. All of this is likely biased by my interpretation* :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n1. [p0] Mobile site buttons (converse, build, apps) are too clickable and everything seems disabled.\n2. [p0] Mobile site banner should say go to `aihub.instabase.com (http://aihub.instabase.com)` not go to `desktop site` .\n3. [p0] Converse - People tend to add files to the sample project instead of a new conversation.\n4. [p0] Apps - Hard to get back to AIHub discover from here, default is going back to my hub which is confusing. \n5. [p0] My hub - Hard to get to converse from here which is our flagship experience.\n6. [p0] Billing - Hard to understand this page as a user and which bucket I'll fall into.\n7. [p1] Converse - when a file gets added, we don't automatically navigate to the uploaded file\n8. [p1] Converse - advanced model response is slow, so sometimes they tend to look away. Should we have a better waiting experience.\n9. [p1] Docs - Why is the content only viewable in 1/4th of the screen, we should make it a full page screen. \n10. [p1] Docs - How do I navigate back to the homepage.",

Instead of posting feedback and giving personal priorities in a Slack message, we need to really think about how to collect feedback and ship product in an organized fashion. Can you and @Varun Jain come up with a process when we are doing the next release?\n\nEMs --- please do not jump and make changes to the product for every slack message.",

For example, see https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13514529?hl=en \n• Design of the docs page -- not displaying docs in full width is also a very common design practice, see https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3742473-chatgpt or the above google docs link -- it's for the ease of reading. \nWe need to be careful taking every user confusion and make it a \"should\" request to our product.",
