      "message": "Not necessarily sure where to make this ask but- for AI Hub, have we been testing other models to use besides just GPT? Citi is asking if this is our product direction to be multi-model, and if so they are willing to partner with us on this initiative and doing any comparison work, etc.\n\nPer our champion, Tod, they are specifically interested in Gemini and Claude.. and Citi has also approved Llama3 and Mistral. They have concerns with OpenAI as they just found an increasing amount of vulnerabilities in GPT 4o. Any product / leadership help here would be greatly appreciated as we are trying to close the SaaS/AI Hub deal with Citi by 12/10. Thanks!",

Would be great for you and him to connect directly to form the relationship, and discuss the long term product vision to hook up other models, and how/if Citi can be part of that process (if it’s helpful for us)",
