The last blocker bug is almost merged in.\nWill post on Monday that the internal preview is live.\n\nWe had a prototype launch before - got a bunch of user feedback\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ri9PeOR8AZYG4yLDv-svNXhabRAOTB2v2CFrDcKNBE/edit?tab=t.0 - take a read when free\n\nI have made @jemin.jain @pauline.comising @Abhishek Adupa admins on aihub-sandbox. @ayesha.ali and @Weiming Wu already have admin accounts.\nYou should be able to access the apps referenced. You can find app metadata (like input dir/output dir) by MySQL querying in Grafana.\n```SELECT * FROM instabase.job_metadata WHERE job_id=<>```\nGoing forward it is imperative that when we merge new changes, we ensure things are functioning and donâ€™t break.",
