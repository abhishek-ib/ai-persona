I need it in integrations UDF; I.E: Salesforce Case ID is passed in, so when the fields are being extracted, the integration code can write to the right Salesforce Case\n2. I need it in the validations UDF : @fernando.piazza.ctr a usecase where the customer wants to pass some fields in (i.e date or user id) and use that to compare to whats been extracted from the page. If it isnt correct it needs to be flagged - i reckon we could still use the custom python function integrations for this",
