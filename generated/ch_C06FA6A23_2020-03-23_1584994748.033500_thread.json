      "message": "Hello, engineering! I have a customer who is having issues when running `diff checker` with documents of 300 to 350 pages in length. It reports back “The diff robot is broken”. Screenshot available in https://instabase.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/535. My guess is our response is going to boil down to “We didn’t plan on people diffing that large of documents, sorry, we’ll put handling it on our backlog.” But before I sent that back I figured I’d check in and see if I was off base.",
