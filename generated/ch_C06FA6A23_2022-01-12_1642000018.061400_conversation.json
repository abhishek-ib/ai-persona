      "message": "Hi all — *We’ve migrated dogfood to run on the Control Plane! Dogfood has been running on and deploying with the Control Plane for the past 12 hours.* \n\nAs you can see (^), the migration was not without a hitch; dogfood is one of the most complex Instabase environments out there and so there were some expected unforeseen issues. I’ll write up a post mortem detailing the migration and learnings, so that we make this more seamless going forward.\n\n*Going forward, all configuration changes to dogfood will need to be made through Control Plane.* Base Configurations are stored here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/tree/master/deployment-configs); the patches currently in dogfood are tracked here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/tree/master/deployment-configs/environment-patches/dogfood). Before making a patch to dogfood, you should add it to that directory to track and go through code review, then send it to the Control Plane APIs. The readme (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/deployment-configs/README.md) in that directory contains more information. You can find detailed documentation on Control Plane in our confluence (https://instabase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CP/overview?homepageId=1629454558), api docs (https://instabase.com/docs/reference/apis/control-plane/), or find us at <#C027EPGM2UQ|>.\n\nIf you encounter any issues that might be a result of the migration, please check in on <#C02TJR1QA05|>, where it is being tracked. We will also be posting a few more detailed updates on new developments and the rollout of Control Plane on our Workplace group (https://instabase.workplace.com/groups/thethingthatdoesthethings) over the next two weeks (pls join to stay posted!).",
