      "message": "Based on @Gaurav Saini’s analysis, the image itself contains text in addition to the invisible machine readable text here. Identifying whether the image portion also contains text won't be an easy task. But again, this looks like a unique edge case. I'm not sure why the PDF contain text in image as well as in an invisible layer. If the text was only in the image, we would have considered it as a scanned document and performed OCR, which won't have overlapping texts.\n\nWe can also do force image OCR always. But that's wasteful for regular machine readable PDFs in terms of time & resource usage, as well as the quality of the translated PDF output (it's easier to preserve styles in a machine readable PDFs).",
