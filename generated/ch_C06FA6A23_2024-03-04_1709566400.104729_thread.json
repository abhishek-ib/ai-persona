It seems like when goldens are generated via an input folder (direct link to folder)  instead of from an input samples set (added to the flow and the flow makes a copy of it), the filename differs. For the input samples added to the flow, it does not have the file extension (e.g. `.pdf` ), while goldens generated from an \"external\" input folder will contain the file extension.\n\nThis led the comparison to have 0 overlap.\n\nDo you know if this is fixed in later version?",

You can select an input folder via the dropdown - these are inputs that have been copied / added to the flow. (Shown in the red box)\n2. You can select any folder as an input folder via the file explorer.
