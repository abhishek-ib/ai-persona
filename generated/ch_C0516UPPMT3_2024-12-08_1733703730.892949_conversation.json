(SS1 & SS2) It would be helpful to see `Project Overall` colored/shaded to distinguish project level metrics vs other classes that may be present\n2. (SS1 & SS3) There were no validation rules set, so technically, no extractions failed validations. However, would it be possible to replace the green checkmarks with the grey circled `-`'s instead (SS4)? (Ideally, we'd be able to either:\n    a. (SS4) hover over the different validation symbols (checks, exes, dashes) to know what they mean\n    b. refer to a legend somewhere easily shown to know what the different validation symbols mean",
