It currently requires an API token, and we are currently using his token and this works.\n\nWe currently need this code to run another POV. What I did was I generated my own Token through the profile page (https://aihub.uat.instabase.com/apps/admin/users/gwen.wong/profile) and it appears that my Account/Token does not have ‘a licence’. Is there a way to turn this on at all?",
