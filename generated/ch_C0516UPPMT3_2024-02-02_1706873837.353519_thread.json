      "message": "OK I think I know where the confusion is. Let me update the ticket to make it clearer... summarizing it here. There are 2 problems:\n1. The bug is we have 2 postman buttons in the docs, they point to different collections :facepalm: @jean we will correct this on Monday \n    a. The one on https://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/apis/index.html points to a collection that the same as @Leeâ€™s \n    b. The one on https://aihub.instabase.com/docs/aihub/apis/postman/index.html points to the collection that @Gwen has a screenshot on\n2. The 2 collections seem to be roughly the same\n    a. This version duplicates the API for commercial and community, put IB-context in commercial only \n    b. This version does not duplicate APIs but seems to assume the user is a commercial user; IB-context is in the call already. It also has a few more APIs \nAction items:\n1. We should use the same Postman collection in both places; so let's correct the links first. We can use Lee's / the first one's format if we found just having two folders is easier. We'll do that Monday morning cc @jean and close the ticket after that. \n2. On the eng side @Anil is leading the API usability effort. Anil, can you reach out to @Balaram @Lee to get some context next week, and let's have one postman collection that we all contribute to instead of having separate ones. Everyone can contribute to the postman collection, but I'll have Anil be the owner going forward from the Eng side so we approach API usability in a holistic way. After we have a unify repo, we'll point the links in the docs to that one. Thanks team.",
