      "message": "Hey everyone, status update on the tests failing in CI - we changed a bunch of new enterprise features to GA, and the logic is such that the features showed up in commercial orgs while they were IB_OPT_OUT, but now that they're GA, they're only enabled in enterprise orgs.\n\nI have a PR open here (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/58810) to make these failing tests use enterprise users, but we also need to finish getting some state set up in these orgs and we also need to deploy a fix for a recently introduced backend bug. Hoping to get this in ASAP! In the meantime, you might need to force merge time-sensitive PRs",
