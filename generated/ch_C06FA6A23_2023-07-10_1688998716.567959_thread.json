      "message": "it’s not that cypress tests take 4+ hours, they usually take around 2-3. The main reason usually is failures where for each test, it can wait up to 1 minute for an element to show up. Maybe we can try shortening this wait time by default to around 15 seconds and see how it impacts the tests. The # of failed tests also is going up so that doesn’t help with timing.",
