      "message": "For config migration, can we have filesystem migration scripts similar to what’s possible for databases when migrating from releases? Even if we don’t officially support it in the platform, in theory I would assume we should be able to because this is likely a common problem in many systems? And as is we do store some information in the FS already, it’s just split across the database as well and not always consistent\n\nFor making sure configs in the FS are valid with user tampering, can we ensure regular users wouldn’t have access to directly modifying our files? I believe we do this already? Also wouldn’t the same problem of config validity exist for a lot of things in the filesystem today? (like ibmsg files, ibflowresults, etc.)\n\nFor querying across projects, I’m assuming that per project configuration details like validation rules, project classes, etc. aren’t fetched across projects based on how I’ve used Build features",
