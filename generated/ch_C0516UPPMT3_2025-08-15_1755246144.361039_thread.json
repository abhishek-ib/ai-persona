      "message": "@Serena thank you. I confirm we're talking about the AI Hub\n\n1. The discrepancies they noticed is that their YAML file did not reference the possibility to add custom keys in the body of the [POST] RUN deployment endpoint.\n2. Here another example from the partner: \"_the \"files\" endpoint keep disappearing one after another in the API documentation. As of today I can only see the [GET] read file endpoint (https://docs.instabase.com/api-sdk/api-reference/files/read-file) Although the Yaml file still references the PUT and HEAD an DELETE methods...A few days ago, these methods were still in a section of the API doc._\n      _So here lies my questions:_\n• _if these methods are still supported, why are they deleted from the official API doc? Even if they are flagged as [DEPRECATED] they should be document if they exist, shouldn't they?_\n       _This give me the impression that the PUT HEAD and DELETE file methods will be silently shut down without prior notice    as I have experienced similar cases previously with Instabase: is this true? If so, deleting the file endpoints could lead to issues for my technical integrations so I would be glad if we can sort this out\"_ \n_@subbu_",
