Happy to capture those details and turn them into JIRA tickets.\n\nCertainly agree the Python 3 transition is painful, but I see this as more of a Post-mortem around our UAT process, as these issues should get caught during our User Acceptance Testing.\n\nCould people help provide features and issues which are not working in Python 3? I can follow-up with each individual eng owner to make sure we have appropriate UAT testing to ensure that we flag these issues at each release testing time",
