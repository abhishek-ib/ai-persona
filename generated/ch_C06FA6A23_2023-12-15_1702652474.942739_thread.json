Meaning, keywords that we would use to match a charge on an invoice. For example, 'Lock Charge,' 'Disposal,' and 'Fuel.' These are variable charges where we can usually not match by $ amount so word association would be the solution. I want to understand what the future looks like in being able to match.\"\n\nIs this something that could be solved with AI Hub?",
