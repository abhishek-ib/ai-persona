      "message": "Hi team, I'm seeing an unexpected issue with the search functionality in the Explorer app on the IB platform. The search functionality only seems to work for expanded folders or at the base level. What I mean by this is that I cannot search for files or folders that are nested in other folders, unless I have already expanded them previously.\n\nFor example, I have a file called `reduce_udf.udf` that is nested in the `.instabase_projects` folder. If I search for it, nothing will come up. However if I expand the folders and reveal the file then the search will work as expected. To go one step further - if I now collapse the folder again, the context is kept and the search will still work.\n\nIs this a known issue?",

      "message": "I wish it worked the way you're describing, but unfortunately it can't - it's more of a filter than a search really. It's all done on the frontend by looking through the nodes that are already loaded. It's most useful if you have a long list of files and you're looking for a certain one.\n\nIf you truly want to search, I'd recommend using the search functionality that you can find by clicking the magnifying glass on the lefthand dock.",
