Right now my feature in question is under `Internal Opt in` which has the following description: `Opt-in features might not be fully stable but are available for testing...`  — however in this case I think we should actually specify that this feature is *not* available for testing.\n\nI wonder if we’ve thought about this case with our current feature flagging system?",
