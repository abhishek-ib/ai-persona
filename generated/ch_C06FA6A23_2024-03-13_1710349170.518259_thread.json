But I would find it really useful if someone wants to spearhead a channel for python/go questions in the future :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nIn manage_apps_server.py, I am using request.is_json (https://tedboy.github.io/flask/generated/generated/flask.Request.is_json.html). Mypy is giving me this error: `\"IBRequest\" has no attribute \"is_json\"`. It seems to be working in the code, and I don't see anything in the special IBRequest type (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/blob/master/shared-utils/py-utils/typing-utils/src/py/stubs/flask/globals.pyi#L10) that extends Request that would make this not work. Any ideas how to fix this?",
