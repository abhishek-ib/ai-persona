      "message": "I can reproduce the attached error with a 6pg PDF invoice the default model fails with “*Unable to send message* Error during model run.” Interestingly the advanced model runs fine. Other invoices from this provider fail using the default model as well. Deleting the doc, and adding it again also doesn’t help. Other documents with the default model work fine, so it seems to be an issue with the PDF and the default model. Here is the doc url (https://aihub.instabase.com/hub/apps/converse/e276a492-d916-4cfe-a2d4-6e1410ad2da3) if it helps for investigation.",
