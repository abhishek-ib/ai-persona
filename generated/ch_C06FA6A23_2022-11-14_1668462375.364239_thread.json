And API to retrieve flow info to render the frontend should go in apps-server? How about creating a flow or editing a flow? They interact with file system, shouldn't they be deemed as a part of  the public SDK?",

      "message": "Cool. :D yeah, interacting with the file system doesn't matter, or justify that it needs to be a public SDK. It depends on whether the functionality is meaningful to be exposed for customer to use without going through our UI. Public APIs need to be designed more thoughtfully because once they are shipped out, we are supposed to maintain backward compatibility and have to be supported “forever”. They also also adhere to Instabase’s API standards so that our entire SDK has uniformity.",
