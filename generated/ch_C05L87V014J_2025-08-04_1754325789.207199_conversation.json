      "message": "Hey all, I may have discovered one of the problem we have w/ dockerd. Our base image has the incorrect version of runc -- 1.2.5. The runc version should be 1.12.x. It looks to me like an older `runc` is getting erroneously installed -- the docker daemon has 1.12.x built-in, but it prefers to use the system runc if available. In my testing, with 1.12.x, builds are more stable (though not quite 100% stable yet). I'll ping here when I have the base image updated.",
