      "message": "*<!here>* Tomorrow, we will be migrating the Python CI pipeline to Python 3.9. This will be a two-step process where we first update the dependency snapshot, then merge in the pipeline/image update PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/69399).\n\nThis should be a relatively seamless transition, but it’s possible that a test which passes in Python 3.7 fails in Python 3.9. If so, please tag the appropriate test owners to fix their tests.\n\nIf you need to add a package to the dependency list, please add it to `third-party/bazel/py/requirements_py39_linux.in` and regenerate `third-party/bazel/py/requirements_py39_linux.txt`.\n\n*Rollback plan:* In the event that it must be rolled back, can simply revert the pipeline PR and switch back to the old site-packages snapshot.\n\nIf you want to test this change ahead of time, please try stacking a PR against the update PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/69399)\n\nSpecial thanks to @Anil for helping debug flow server tests, and @Cody Boggs for helping with Jenkins .",
