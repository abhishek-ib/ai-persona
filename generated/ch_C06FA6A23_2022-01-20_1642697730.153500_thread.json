      "message": "hey team, i just found out in thread attached that models trained on 21.12 can't be run in 21.10, due to a huggingface dependency introduced in dec. is this something could be patched for backwards compatibility? especially since multiple clients recently upgraded/are in the process of upgrading to 21.10, and some will be using models trained by solution eng.\n\notherwise solution engineering will need to remember train models for certain clients in our 21.10 sandbox, and won't have access to the latest features while they work.\n\ncc @alagar",
