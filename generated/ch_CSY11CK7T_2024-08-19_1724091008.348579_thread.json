      "message": "*Summary for Cypress On-Call for August 12-16*\nLast week was a busy week! As most of you know, we had to disable some/all tests as they were blocking PRs from being merged. This was the timeline of events:\n• Monday\n    ◦ PRs blocked due CJ’s Github credentials being revoked, causing Crafting PR sandboxes to fail on creation. Thread 1 (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1723486308529699?thread_ts=1723485817.903339&cid=CSY11CK7T), Thread 2 (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C03B865Q74K/p1723486134977309)\n• Tuesday\n    ◦ We had some org related issues blocking PRs, which was promptly handled by @Xindi Xu :tada:  Thread 1 (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1723561577287349)\n    ◦ We also had `workspaces-drives-crud.spec.ts` failing consistently due to search-service being down/flaky. They are still skipped/non-blocking, we’re waiting on a fix (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C011FHLBN8N/p1723140882270109).\n• Wednesday\n    ◦ We had `file-list.spec.ts` and `results-table.spec.ts` tests failing consistently, which have been skipped. Did we have a resolution for this @Jessica?\n    ◦ We disabled all tests (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1723658934347799?thread_ts=1723658164.045079&cid=CSY11CK7T) due to a weaviate issue on file upload (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1723658164045079). This was ultimately due to our DB being undersized (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/C01N7DV1137/p1723666222918379?thread_ts=1723658240.438109&cid=C01N7DV1137) and reaching the connection limit.\n• Thursday\n    ◦ Tests are still disabled.\n• Friday\n    ◦ Tests were re-enabled (https://instabase.slack.com/archives/CSY11CK7T/p1723828305221009?thread_ts=1723658164.045079&cid=CSY11CK7T) after we provisioned a larger DB. Thanks @Weiming Wu :tada:  for fixing a bug that snuck into master while the tests were disabled.\nUltimately, most of these issues were infrastructure related issues outside of Cypress. However, these failures were still insightful on the failure points of the platform. So in a sense, you could say that Cypress was uncovering bugs beyond just frontend code changes! Wow, cool :cool-doge:\n\nThere are still a number of tests that are skipped/non-blocking that we need to re-enable. I trust that the test owners are tracking those and will re-enable them over the coming days (me included).",
