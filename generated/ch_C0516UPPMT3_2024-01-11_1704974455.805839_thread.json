      "message": "Hi Team, concern I've heard a few times from customers (primarily Insurance) when talking about AI-Hub is credit usage. In AXA's case if they went ahead with AI-Hub single tenant and gave access to a pool of their users they don't want certain employees blowing through a disproportionate amount of credits, also they want clear visibility into how many credits would be burned. Is it on the roadmap to add functionality to forecast credit usage when building apps, or even some easy credit usage estimates shown per converse session?",
