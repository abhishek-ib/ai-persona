Do we have any recommendations for how to save a copy (for back up) of entire workspace in case the drive crashes or the project folder is corrupted/extreme worst case inceident takes place? BofA has a project with more than 50k documents that they need to back up and the folder is too large to download/copy.\n\nAny advice for this would be much appreciated!\ncc: @shaunak",
