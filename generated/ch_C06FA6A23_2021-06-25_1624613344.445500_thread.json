I think we should try and support them through our apps instead of letting the users edit through file system or text editor. Arbitrary changes to these output files just makes it really hard to make our apps stable cuz there's too many edge cases to account for.",

An example of this is with some use cases where files and then future amendments are processed. We detect the amendments and combine with the original into a single record.",

Before we change the behavior, let’s improve our docs and training materials so how flow results are retrieved are clear to everyone, at least our power users and our own people. The syndrome here is clear - if people modify the flow output folder, some unexpected behaviors might happen. Let’s define those “unexpected behaviors”, educate everyone and give ourself some time to come up with a good solution.",
