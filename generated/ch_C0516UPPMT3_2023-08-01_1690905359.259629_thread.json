      "message": "Hi AI hub team, is there any existing methods or strategies in place to facilitate the implementation of a test set for unit testing prompts? For instance, a process where you upload 10 documents, manually annotate them, and subsequently assess the prompt accuracy on these documents. The concern is that as customers utilize prompts to extract information from various documents, over time, modifications made to handle specific cases might unintentionally disrupt the accuracy of previously functional documents.",
