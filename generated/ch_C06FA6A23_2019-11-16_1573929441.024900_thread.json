We are going rebuild all base images today and patch latest release branches for PY2, PY3, and special JPMC branch.\n\nHow does this specifically impact you?\n\n1. If you rely on docker environment for your local builds, any new first-time docker build after base image change will take significant amount of time to complete.\n2. It is very very unlikely this base image upgrade will have any negative consequence however we will push PY2 version to dogfood and sanity check. If something breaks, we will reach out to you.",
