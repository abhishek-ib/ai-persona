The icon colors are not the same color as the text. The color on the `MY PROJECT` heading is looking especially lighter - looks like it is disabled. \n• There's a lot going on with the variations of font-sizes, shades of gray, and weights in the middle section (with the workspace dropdown, heading, and the project list). Is there a way to improve the clarity and hierarchy here? Currently it's hard to infer that the `MY PROJECTS` is a heading of the project list (likely because the heading is lighter, of the same size, and has even spacing on its top and bottom).",
