We have plan to make a deployment creation UI more like what we saw in flow editor now. \n• I didn't see \"submit and next\" button shown in the screenshot. My guess is that you are referring to the action where you mark every document as reviewed and submit the whole job. We could see if making an update of the content make sense. In the future, if the review task is document based we should only show one button. cc @Bastiane and @hannah here to see if it makes sense.\n• I believe if you mark document as reviewed you will overwrite all the errors shown in the document. cc@Bastiane and @andy for confirmation. With that being said, we can revisit how we handle exceptions in HR. I believe we had plan to introduce overwrite exceptions in HR.",
