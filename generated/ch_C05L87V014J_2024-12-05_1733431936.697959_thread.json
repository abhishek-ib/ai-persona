The build up of configs is only an issue for our internal envs that we update several times a day. Our customers generally don't upgrade often enough (yet) for the DB to get saturated like this.\n\nWe also don't enforce any particular version string pattern, so while versions in DM configs are conventionally in the `XX.XX.XX` pattern, they don't have to be for DM to accept them. This is because we've had customers in the past request to use their own versioning conventions.",
