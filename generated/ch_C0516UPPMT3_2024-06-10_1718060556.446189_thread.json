We previously did exactly this, but this led to severe performance issues (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-2042) that made the UI super slow whenever you made any change to the code editor.\n\nTo avoid the performance issues, we cannot re-render the entire results table (ie show “Outdated” next to each cell under “Final result” / “Validation result”) when the code is changed.\n\nAs an alternative, we could show “Outdated” at a higher level (ex: show “Outdated” next to the “Final result” / “Validation result” column name) - would that be clear enough?",
