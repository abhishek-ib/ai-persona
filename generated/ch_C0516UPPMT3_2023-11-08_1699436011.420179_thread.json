Clicked on an invoice but got field suggestions for passport\n2. Tried to add a new class for invoice but got a suggestion for passport\n3. After adding some fields, adding classes and reclassyfing I wanted to add fields to the second class and got an error `Failed to get suggested fields`",

If you create classes, we’ll use the first document of each class to suggest fields\n2. I’ve seen this as well - the class suggestion may be loaded after the user starts typing. I think that we can show a better loading state if we’re still loading the class suggestion \n3. We’ll have to look into this error - can you provide this project id so that we can search the logs?",
