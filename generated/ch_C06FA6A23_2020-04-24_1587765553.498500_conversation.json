      "message": "I hope my words are looked at under the lens of constructive and caring ( :heart: ), but I think we as an organization/company/whatever are going through some growing pains in terms how we're communicating. The project deletion thing above is an example of that, but there have been a few others recently where things like UI and app behavior changes happen and end up causing issues on the non-eng side of the house.\n\nFor example, if the UI or behavior of some component changes without folks from training, docs, or anyone doing customer-facing work being looped in the right way (which is different depending on the things - could be after work is done, could be when scoping of the work is happening), it can cause situations where what those folks normally do in front of customers or other folks doesn't work. Ends up making for not great situations.\n\nSpeaking for myself, my understanding is that we're as a company trying to use Jira as the standard place to bridge gaps, scope and track work, and make sure that we have a source of truth. That's what \"who is on first\" means to me.\n\nWe need a system/process/something where the right people are brought in so we can all be successful, but I don't believe we're there yet. I'm curious what folks think and what we could change or do differently on this stuff :slightly_smiling_face:.",

      "message": "Echo’ing john here, as I usually am one to be kicking and screaming in slack. The one thing I’d find super valuable is sort of like our Demo Days but more on the here is how you train customer facing folks on new features/feature changes. It always sucks going into a demo and an interface has just changed, disappear, breaks, etc.\n\nIt’s also super cool to see a new feature pop up and I want to attempt to use it (I watch the awesome videos but sometimes I need a bit more situational context). It always helps to know how to frame features so we don’t missell them or mislead them.",
