      "message": "Hi team - noticed a bug in AI Hub Converse, particularly prevalent with Multistep reasoning. When you ask a question, then move to another conversation, it continues rendering the steps in the other conversation, not the one you asked it in. Video here for further context. I think this will just be when the same document appears in both conversations, like is shown here. Document I was using attached, and prompt in the thread",

This report also includes 2022 UK, Overseas and Total data in the table, but ignore those figures and report figures only from \"2021 total\". Return strictly as JSON with the headings: Company name, Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (location-based), unit of emissions. This should report on actual performance, rather than specific to a particular line of business. Convert the output into mt (CO2e million tonnes), and output to 3 DP.",
