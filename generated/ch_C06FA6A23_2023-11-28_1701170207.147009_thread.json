In some sense, this could simply be a marketing slide: \"The life of a document....\"  That doesn't seem useful in an engineering context, though.  That's why I normally just show a picture of a flow with the steps of Digitization (OCR/image processing) -> Classification (DL) -> Extraction (DL) -> Refinement and integration.",
