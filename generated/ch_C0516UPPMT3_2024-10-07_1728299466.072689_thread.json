      "message": "Hey team, recently I’ve seen a lot of customers with use cases requiring split classification (mainly in banking areas this seems to be very common). While it is always a big differentiator over competition, I find it to be one of the most temperamental features on the platform, so much so that I try to caveat the feature with a warning during demos/POCs. In the ANZ POC we’ve been running, it’s the only part of the 5 stage solution we have had to use DL for (there are only 4 classes but LLMs were performing poorly).\n\nDo we have a strategy/plans to improve this feature in AI Hub? Given that Commercial customers don’t have access to advanced apps it feels like we would need to do this well out the box",
