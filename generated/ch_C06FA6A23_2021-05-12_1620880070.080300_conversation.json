I have adjusted our Dogfood and UAT deployment schedules so that we can start running Golden Tests on UAT without clobbering the results of Golden Tests on Dogfood.\nNow, the deploy to Dogfood will happen every 4 hours starting at 12am, and the deploy to UAT will happen every 4 hours starting at 2am. If you are manually triggering a Deploy or Golden test run, please check to make sure it won’t conflict with a Golden run on the other environment.",
