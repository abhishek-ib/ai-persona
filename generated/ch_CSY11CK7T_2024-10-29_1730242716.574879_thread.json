      "message": "Hey @Serena this would be a good addition to frontend observability. Also smth that never got above priority. If you are looking for help @abhitaker might have good context here.\n\nMy personal take on choice of backends- go with Faro as it will be much easier to integrate and ship. Usability in form of alerts etc will be much better. Sentry also has a license to procure? Btw Grafana labs move their offerings fast to catch up with competitors quickly in general",
