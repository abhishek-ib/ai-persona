      "message": "Another small nitpick - I know it says do not navigate away from page (which I assume refers to a website), if I click on slack (or any other app) while things are uploading (which can take a long time with 6 long PDFs), then the upload message disappears and there is just a white page. That can take a long time. Only after a while, you see the file names appearing in the document window and you realize things are still uploading. Multiple times I thought things had crashed and refreshed it to redo it and patiently uploaded all files without touching anything else.",

Right now it is just circling and you're not sure how far along it is. Not an issue with a single short file, but if you have a dozen heavy ones, it is quite different",
