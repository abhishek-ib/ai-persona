      "message": "> • Extracting a single data point where you need to provide more context: an example is captured in Taxdown video. What’s our guidance on what users should do this such cases?\nJust want to note that this use case is documented. You can enter a short field name, then edit the field and enter a more complex prompt, even with extraction mode selected.\n\nI haven't tried it, but I wonder if this method^ would also work for extracting a clause. The multiple data points (list) and table use cases seem like they would be best addressed with data types.\n\nI might have missed some nuance here, but I thought the main difference between these two modes centers on provenance: extraction mode looks for _actual text_ in the document and returns provenance, and reasoning mode doesn't have that limitation.",
