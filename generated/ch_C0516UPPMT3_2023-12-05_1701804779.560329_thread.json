I encourage internal users to create team-based workspaces and for our growth team to help set up workspaces for our commercial customers (cc: @Tom @Lee).\n\nYou can move projects across workspaces by clicking the three dots on the project card in My Hub. This is useful if you have a project built in a personal workspace and you'd like to share it with your team.\n\nAs always, please try out and share feedback in this channel to help us keep improving!",
