They didn’t say it outright, but implied we charge for everything. If this OCR step can be turned off, then they could just upload the file directly.\n\ncc: @jade.kelly @Alex Sgueglia\n\n1: Do we charge for the OCR step?\n2. After the file is OCR’d, it automatically runs the field that triggers an LLM call.",
