In some cases it can be a probability of that character, in some cases it can be a non-probability score, etc…\n2. (This is the main thing that confused them) the confidence score and “unsure” flag have really no correlation - you can have a score of 0.05 and still be sure about the character, and then a situation with a confidence of 0.95 and unsure would be marked as true\n3. Low confidences and high confidences aren’t often useful - you can have entire words where each character is marked with a confidence of 0, but the word is still extracted correctly. \n(Note that these anecdotes are from before we used Microsoft OCR, their results may be different)\nSo in the end, we disabled the functions that would allow customers to get raw confidence results, because we found that they were not that useful. Given those anecdotes, for instance, if the logic from the customer was to “mark as needing validation any result that has an average OCR confidence of less than 0.75”, there isn’t a very good correlation between those results and actual OCR errors",

For example something that is wrong but has a high confidence, we don't want to be on the hook for that.\n\nI also think it adds a whole new layer of complexity and friction to achieving STP, where if confidence is used as a filter our numbers will inevitably only go down as more data is filtered out",
