      "message": "Hi there! I'm not sure how long this bug has existed but for the past couple (working) days I've seen that I cannot add files in projects. I tested this issue occurs on both crafting and sandbox\n\nWhen I create a project, add a file, it doesn't show anything but then adding another file throws this error. Do you know where this could be from?\n\ni think it occurs if I go to create cross class fields or fields immediately after uploading. However, if I wait for it to load the document shows up correctly.",

You might need to kill the project, and next time wait until the file is finished uploading before you try to upload another one.",

The status bar shouldn't disappear when switching pages but this has been a known UI bug :sweat_smile: I think disabling buttons until things are valid would be the next step here, we have a bad habit of not doing this in our codebase but I've been slowly refactoring while doing my feature tickets to disable actions that are dependent on BE whenever I touch that part of the code.",
