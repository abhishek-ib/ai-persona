      "message": "Hi just some feedback we got from running a workshop with some partners. We found that\n1. Customers on their first use were unaware that there is a concept of ‘projects’ and would be stuck on the starter build project. It wasn’t clear to them that you had to drag your mouse all the way to the left to reveal a list of projects, and did not know you could have multiple projects\n2. There are multiple + buttons and their inherent proximity to its use is not standardized, and that gets them confused; ie \n+ button right aligned on Classes, + button is on the left of create field, + button to add documents is under Documents, the + button on projects needs you to push your mouse to the left and select the + button, but it overlaps the documents + button when it opens causing more confusion",
