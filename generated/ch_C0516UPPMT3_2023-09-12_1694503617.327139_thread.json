      "message": "Good point @hannah. Now, that we can use LLM in refiner with Azure EU there will be less of a need.\n\nInstead, it would be important for the EMEA team that we roughly keep feature parity between AIHub and ib_llm_tools. For example, in two weeks there will be advanced table recognition available in refiner. It would be great if the ib_llm_tools also gets the feature shortly after and can be used with both with Azure EU and OpenAI.",
