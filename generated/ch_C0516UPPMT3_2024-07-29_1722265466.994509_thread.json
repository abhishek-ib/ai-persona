Specifically, I’m confused on whether clicking “copy link” and sharing that would allow someone access even if the radio selection is “just me”.  My suggestion would be only showing the “copy link” button if the sharing perms are set to “anyone in the org”  cc @avi  (also @andy bc we use the same design for app sharing)",
