      "message": "Giving both options is no harder but poses a UX difficulty - for the \"load all\" button, I was planning on putting it in the row as a little icon. For a \"load next x\" button, it doesn't make as much sense to put it there because you'd have to scroll up to click it each time, assuming, you've scrolled down to see your new files. And I don't know how I feel about adding a new \"node\" at the bottom of a list that's a button because it will complicate the model a lot... maybe I could add the load next button in the row of the last node of the list?",
