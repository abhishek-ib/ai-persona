So how do we think about the larger problem of, Instabase users need to be able to build and execute scripts... what level of privilege/imports do we give them. We also need to think about site admins ability to wrap anything they want into a binary and deploy. It’s a good faith policy right now but that may need to change. \n\nI didn’t realize as a site admin I could build a UDF wrap it in a binary and let anyone use it...",
