Refer to this document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k03QjaFCJ9aMJLnLuvdOg-CRORHRafEO4YQQgoeQtDg/edit) for instructions and commands that will help you migrate your active branches and re-point any local clones of the repo to the upstream URL.\n2. Once you've migrated your clone(s) and any active branches, head over to Sandbox ICC (https://sandbox.console.instabase.com/sandbox) and update any sandboxes you've deployed from *any* personal fork - you need only change the `Fork` field in ICC's UI to `instabase`, then run the update.\n:question-block: *Impact*\nAfter the deadline given above:\n1. Sandboxes will *not* be buildable / deployable from forked repos.\n2. ICC will no longer show the `Fork` field when creating or updating a stack.\n3. We will begin removing all occurrences of `INSTABASE_FORK` or similar parameters from *all* pipelines, on `master` and all `release-.*` branches.\n4. All branches being pushed to `instabase/instabase` will need to be uniquely named; I strongly recommend developing a habit of prepending your branch names with a Jira ticket ID, for example `releng-740`, at a minimum.\n:boom: *Something goes wrong?*\nAs always, please jump on over <#C035SLYCJ9X|> with any questions, concerns, or issues you might run into during migration or post-deprecation!\n[Note: DMs will not be answered, and will instead be redirected to the team channel so that we can maintain transparency and knowledge-sharing!]",
