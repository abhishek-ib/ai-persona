And as I rebuild many times, I start to hit another error\n\n```[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.6:single (make-assembly) on project table-tservice: Failed to create assembly: Error creating assembly archive jar-with-dependencies: Problem creating jar: Execution exception: No space left on device -> [Help 1]```\nAny idea how to solve this?\nAnd overall, do you recommend people building things locally on their laptop, or should I just try using our build machine? My internet seems to be fine, but I had hit that internet glitch many times",
