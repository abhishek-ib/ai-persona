      "message": "Hey, I spotted this message today with a photo of the planned design for enabling Form Recogniser. I like the design of this, but I think it would make sense if we don’t reveal that we’re using FR behind the scenes.\n• Quite often an objection we have to handle is people thinking they can build an IDP solution themselves using OCR engines and GPT, and we need to work quite hard to highlight why IB offers value. \n• By showing we are using FR to do certain things, we’re giving more pieces of the puzzle to users thinking they can solve it themselves. Previously when we used FR a lot, as soon as people heard we use it they thing we’re just a wrapper around other peoples tools and don’t offer anything unique. \n• You need to enable this setting for more advanced extraction, which is suggesting when things get hard, we need to fall back to tooling from large CSPs.\nCan we consider renaming this setting to something that doesn’t reveal what makes it work?\n\nhttps://instabase.slack.com/archives/C0185NSBLQZ/p1692193940866729",
