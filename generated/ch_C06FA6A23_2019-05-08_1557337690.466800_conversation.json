      "message": "A few more thoughts on local dev v docker dev. There is space for both styles at Instabase. Ideally, docker is a more correct approach since we run production-grade Instabase on docker containers. This allows us to dogfood locally what we deliver to customers. But, I also understand the frustration due to development slowness that can be introduced by docker.\n.\nIf anyone will like to introduce minikube and use docker for local development. You are more than welcome to do so.",
