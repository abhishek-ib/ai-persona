If the effort to make them pass is really too much, we can consider moving forward by applying the `SKIP_CI` tag, but I’m hoping that we can get them to pass!\n• apps, view-home-page\n• members-crud\n• collab\nI agree we should have flexibility to work around the CI check once it’s blocking (ex: with the `SKIP_CI` tag, or by applying a `no-cypress` Github label, etc), but I hesitate to encourage using this before we’ve even made the CI check blocking",
