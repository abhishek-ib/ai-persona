It feels like the user persona here would actually be willing to wait for amazing results too. For instance, see how Devin handles something like this - takes 40min! to come back, sadly we can't try it so don't know how good the response is.\n\nEthan Mollick on LinkedIn: Most of the conversation I see about AI agents is technical, but the real… | 56 comments (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_most-of-the-conversation-i-see-about-ai-agents-activity-7181651697801297920-yDhU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)",
