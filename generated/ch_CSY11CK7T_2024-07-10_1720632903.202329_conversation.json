      "message": "Hi all, if your PRs are failing because of Cypress tests and these are the failing tests:\n• field-editor.spec.ts - should filter fields and edit fields and classification correctly through field editor\n• file-list.spec.ts - should test all file list functionality including displaying documents correctly, expand/collapse, and filters\n• results-table.spec.ts - should have the correct counts and values and function correctly\n• review-manager-dashboard.spec.ts - should do everything\n• review-reviewer-dashboard.spec.ts - should do everything user can do\n• run-app.spec.ts - runs the app\n• run-public-app.spec.ts - runs the app\nBasically, any test that is running an app. It is safe to force merge - we have a PR to revert the offending code (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/59724)",
