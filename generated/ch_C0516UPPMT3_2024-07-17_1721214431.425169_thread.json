      "message": "Hey team, loving the new homepage design! Couple of pieces of feedback I have:\n1. I find the 'Go To' button a little confusing (to start with). Since its inside the window for recent projects, I actually thought this was a filter option to filter the recent projects to just apps/chats/projects to start with. We might want to consider moving this or adding an additional button?\n2. The 'Go To -> Chats' takes you to the same place as 'Go To -> All Projects'. I think thats because the filter to limit projects to chats only needs to be applied.",
