It was only adding Py3 into the mix that finally surfaced the problem.\n\nI have been trying to activate it by running `/path/to/venv/bin/activate`, which ran without error and I just assumed it worked… but it wasn’t doing anything at all.\n\nInstead, I just realize I have to run `source /path/to/ven/bin/activate`, which does properly set up the venv.\n\nTo be honest, I’m not entirely sure what the difference between the two is, but wanted to post here in case others have been accidentally running it wrong this whole time too :slightly_smiling_face:",
