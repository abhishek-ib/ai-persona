The code is broken and was based on old model of assuming space owner and user is same. I understand this was specifically developed for ~OpenLane~ LendingClub and not being used anymore. Tagging folks here who might have most context on this @shaunak @Ashish - please let know any concerns before we cleanup this code. Thanks!",
