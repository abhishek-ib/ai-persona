      "message": "Hey @Raul MÃ¤chler, figuring out the root cause is taking pretty long.\n\nUltimately it seems like while process-files output was good and there is no issue with the APIs used by frontend either, It was map-records that messed up somewhere that is resulting in an ibmsg witt no lines. While the ibmsg in s1_process-files is about 1mb, the one in s2_map_records is just 11kb. I tried running normal map-records on my system and its working fine so I wanted to take a look at the original flow. Could you point me to that please?",
