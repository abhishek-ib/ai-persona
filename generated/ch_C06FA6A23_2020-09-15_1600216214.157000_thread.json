      "message": "Hi all, not sure if there’s a better channel for this but wanted to call out two platform ACL changes in the latest release.\n1. There’s now a site-wide config option to allow UDF execution everywhere, even in user-owned repos. This is off in our prod env, but for customers env’s, I’d recommend that they flip this on. No more “cannot execute scripts” errors unless their admins actually care about blocking things via fine-grained ACLs. @georgia chestnuts rust-ing on an open fire\n2. The default behaviour for newly created repos in organizations will have fine-grained ACLs disabled rather than enabled. If admins want to opt into the ACL controlled repos, they will have to enable and fill out all the things then. fyi @marie @hollenscary\nHope these things make customer’s lives a bit easier.",
