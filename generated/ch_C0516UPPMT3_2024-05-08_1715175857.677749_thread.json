      "message": "Hey team, I'm pulling out some data from a document and then processing the extraction to get a final result. The issue I'm having is actually how I go about validating this result, given that the end result is only a number (total number of bedrooms across all properties here).\n\nIt would be useful if I could add 'checkpoint validations' where I can validate on an earlier result in the flow (in this case the original JSON extracted) to check for e.g. units that are not part of the address of interest - rather than validating on the end result that is surfaced in HR.\n\nDo we have plans to solve this? Perhaps derived fields will solve this, if there is a toggle to choose whether fields are pushed downstream or not (so I can use these checkpoints for validations without bloating the HR screen?)?",

It seems a bit different from derived fields.\n\nIf the field is hidden in Human Review, how would you be able to see the validation failed? It seems like maybe we'd want a toggle to show \"hidden validated fields\"? This feels like a different request. @Hamish can you create an EPD feature request for this and assign to KD?",
