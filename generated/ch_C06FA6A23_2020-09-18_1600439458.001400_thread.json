(Error='ChordError' object has no attribute 'DESCRIPTOR')```\nfrom the network tab.\n\n@yutaka @Youssef - the frontend is not propagating the errors correctly on both prod and dogfood. Job status API is returning an error, but the frontend failed silently. I’ll open a ticket.",

The files in `s2_map_records` (such as this (https://dogfood.instabase.com/ib_solutions/solutions/fs/Instabase%20Drive/poc/RBC/MCA/RBC_POC_MARCO/input_stp/run_marco/60004-all/2509a78c-2c1f-4d65-84db-4841a2a45056/out/s2_map_records/123456789-60004.pdf.ibdoc)) still has the `processed_image_path` that’s the old image path (instead of 60004-all, the original timestamps), and i believe that’s where the visual refiner fields look for the image. I restored that folder (`2020-09-02-23:57:42`) and was able to run your program using that as the input no problem. We’ll fix the frontend to display the errors correctly.",
