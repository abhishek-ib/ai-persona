      "message": "+1 to what Kerry said. It is definitely a major release, and will go through the same testing as our other major releases. The only difference is because there was < 2 mo between 22.08 and 22.10 there are fewer new features. You can get a sense of this by referencing the Product Overview doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypvtd1N97hFFKVRerP5SKWR253IiY_zDxOmtO3lMq4U/edit), and comparing how there are relatively few entries in 22.10 compared to 22.08.",
