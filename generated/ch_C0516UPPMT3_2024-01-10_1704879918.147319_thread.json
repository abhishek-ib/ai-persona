EPD are currently evaluating the work that would be required to track LLM usage from Refiner, but this would only be available from 24.04 release at the earliest.\n\nIn the meantime, we will handle each customer on a case by case basis. Customers we are aware of that are in this situation are:\n• Cass\n• RSA\n• VRSF\n• RenRe\nPlease reach out to LT directly if you have questions or concerns",

We can make it about rate limits and how that affects their scale specifically for their context.\n\n@BG @Venkatesh @Atul Grover we can discuss where else within Cass we need to be highlighting this and if/how we can highlight it with them from a licensing perspective",
