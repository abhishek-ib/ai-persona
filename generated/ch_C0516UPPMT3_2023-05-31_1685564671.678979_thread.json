Cass have poured a tonne of effort and money into building a reconciliation tool which compares values invoiced against contracted charges. We built it on AI Hub in under 5 mins live with them in the room. There hasn’t been a single person we’ve shown it to that wasn’t stunned with the power it will provide them.\n\nThe responses in chat are now super fast too, almost too fast, it responds quicker than I can think of what to say next in my demo :clap:",
