This is great.\n\n• For logged out website feedback, tagging in @alagu \n• For converse sample prompts, tagging in @margaret.tomaszczuk \n• For UX navigation, this should be fixed soon with some of the upcoming top nav changes\n• For free trial, we can consider adding this to text (agree this is a big selling point). I'll add this to one of our tickets where we are fixing a few things in the sign up flow. \n• On the build and ground truth bugs adding in @Serena \n• For the API feedback and bugs, adding in @Anil",
