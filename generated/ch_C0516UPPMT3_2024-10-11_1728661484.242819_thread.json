      "message": "Hey, some feedback on the new table UX:\n1. There is limit to how wide we can make the columns. This means sometimes you can't view all the content. I'd expect that you could make them as wide as you want and then scroll horizontally to make up for it in the UI or something\n2. It's not clear whether you are seeing the whole table in the preview or not. A complete table (5 rows) and an incompletely shown table (9 rows) look the same on first glance. I'd expect either a 'soft' user queue like a half-revealed row, or a 'hard' user queue like a _+_ or _more_ icon, for them to view the whole result\n3. On tables where all rows are shown, the expand icon is missing. This feels wrong to me as I want to inspect the whole table result while debugging (which I can do for larger tables). Things like expanding row width are made hard atm.\n4. The UI adds extra columns to make the whole width. This is confusing as its hard to know if the empty column is part of the extracted result (3rd column in this video)\n5. Something about the table UI going all the way to the right hand side of the screen feels wrong. I feel like there should be more of a gap at the side",
