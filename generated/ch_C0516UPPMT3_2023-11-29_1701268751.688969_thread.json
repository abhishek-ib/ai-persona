Agree with Hannah that ideally they would clone the build project v/s the app since they'd be able to edit the version there. @Bastiane @Eric Han is this something that you're already considering? If not, should we consider for Q1?\n\nFor apps, we should support multiple versions, but these are intended to be incremental v/s testing variants. Supporting multiple versions was considered for Q4 but didn't make the cut (JIRA) (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-170).",

Are there cases where this isn't true? We can perhaps have apps be published as default \"open source\" so their source projects are clonable. But allow for a toggle if the author doesn't want to share the source",

The neatest way for the app publisher to do this feels like:\n• Keep original project and app\n• Clone original project, make changes, publish new app\nThis ability to clone the build project should only be accessible for the creator of the build project (maybe also someone that has edit access to it in an org).",
