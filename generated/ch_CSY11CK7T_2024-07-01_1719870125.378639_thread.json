With the new background, we should fallback to the pollen theme colors. I still a gray bottom to the background which should ideally be transparent. I will check with TJ on this.\n2. New illustration just came in tonight. I was planning to update it in my morning.\nThanks for working on these changes, @Arjun. If you can share the PR, I can get it backported to 24.26",
