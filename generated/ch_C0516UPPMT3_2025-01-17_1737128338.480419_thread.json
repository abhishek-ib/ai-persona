I wanted to share some feedback regarding the process of adding fields in \"Build.\" Currently, it requires clicking back to add each new field, which can be somewhat cumbersome. It would be more efficient if there were an option to add multiple fields consecutively to then be able to review them all at once.  Then if one is not yielding the desired results (eg. cleaning, description, etc) you would click into that field to edit and configure.",
