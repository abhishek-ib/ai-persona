      "message": "Hey, a couple things I noticed when copying an app. I copied the 1st screenshot (AR Demo) to create the 2nd screenshot (AMC Demo)\n\n1. The copy seems to include some of the previously deleted files. The `New Submission - Deadline Next Week - Equine Product Interest_` doc no longer exists in the AR Demo app, but it shows up in the copied app\n2. The documents in the copied app seem to follow the naming conventions from app runs. Since these are `.eml` files the attached documents are prefixed with the email subject (which is the name of the `.eml` file). That's okay, but the problem is that they are duplicated, as you can see in the `Invoices` class. There are 4 documents but they are just duplicates of the same 2 documents.",
