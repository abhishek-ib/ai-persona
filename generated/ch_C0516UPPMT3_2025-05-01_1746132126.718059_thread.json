      "message": "A piece of feedback that I've encountered a number of times, but is also currently posing challenges with Fannie Mae:\n> Adding cleaning or data handling for when no extracted value is found is very difficult because all the cleaning prompt seems to be \"seeing\" is an empty String.  When the Result says :warning: `No value found.`, the cleaning function's input should be something like `[NO VALUE FOUND]`, similar to how we encode checkboxes and signatures.\n> \n> This would enable us to at least more reliably write a cleaning prompt like `If no value was found, return \"N/A\".` \nEven better:\n> We should add a quick clean function called something like `Replace characters` that can not only do something like replace `|` for `1` easily by a non-technical user, but also could be set to replace `No value found` (regardless of whether it's an empty String or `[NO VALUE FOUND]`) with a given String, such as \"N/A\".\nFannie Mae has made fantastic progress with their big team of non-technical users (Underwriters), but they needed to call in Instabase resources for a last minute onsite workshop partly due to minor usability issues like this which prevent them from being unable to achieve their accuracy targets without technical support.  I believe our vision is for AI Hub to be user friendly enough that non technical users could independently build an app to be production ready.",
