      "message": "Hey folks,\nWe have recently added metrics-server in sandboxes (PR (https://github.com/instabase/instabase/pull/38379)) which is a dependency for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Since this is added in the infra setup, we will have to re run terraform actions while updating a sandbox post `release-23.04`. This is a one time step required for updating any sandbox which was created before 23.04.\nIn jenkins to re run terraform actions `UPDATE_DEPLOYMENT` needs to be unchecked.\nImplications of not having metrics server will be that HPA will not autoscale data services and the replica count will stay at minReplica.\nc.c. <!subteam^S02FJA6A7U5> @Vikas Mehta @anmol.agrawal",
