      "message": "Hi team, had a question about app versions. From my understanding there is no way to edit a previous version of the app right? When you click “Edit App” It looks like it just takes me back to the original project. What about if I want to just view the fields in a previous version of the app, what would I do in that scenario?",

However, you can view the app schema & validation rules for previous versions in the new apps UI, which can be enabled in internal preview (Settings > Account > Preview Features > Enable new user interface for apps). This will let you select old app versions to see which fields and validations they included, but it won't show details like python code.",
