      "message": "Hey team! I have a question about using the `TableGrid` component from Pollen.\nI'm implementing filters in a table with a “Show more” button. The button currently shows based on the total number of rows before filtering:\n\n```const allRows = [\n  { type: 'Text', field: 'name' },\n  { type: 'Text', field: 'address' },\n  { type: 'List', field: 'items' },\n  // ... total of 15 rows\n];```\nWe show “Show more” if `allRows.length > 10`.\n\nHowever, filtering (e.g. only showing rows with `type === 'List'`) is handled internally by the `TableGrid` component. So even if the filtered result only has 3 rows, we’re still showing the “Show more” button — because we’re checking `allRows.length`, not the number of rows actually rendered.\n\nIs there a way to access the number of _currently rendered_ (i.e., filtered) rows from the `TableGrid` component so we can conditionally show the “Show more” button only when it makes sense?\n\nOr... if we are already allowing `search`, and now adding filtering. Do we need the show more button?\n\nFor this table.",
