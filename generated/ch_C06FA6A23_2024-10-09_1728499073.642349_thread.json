It just indiscriminately deletes the first N tags it finds until it's down to <=299 tags (just the hack logic I had to use for the sake of unblocking everyone).\n\nIf there are environments that fail on missing expected images, they'll need to be redeployed to get a new image built, tagged, and pushed.",
