When I resize the window to half of my screen, the chat disappears, but when I go back to full-screen, the chat reappears again. I can't find any button that would reopen the chat when I'm sized to half the screen, and I also can't find the chat at all on the page (e.g. it doesn't show up when I scroll around).",
