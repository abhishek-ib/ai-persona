      "message": "Feature improvement request/bug?:\n\nWhen configuring `class-level` `field-confidence` rules applicable to `All fields`, it would be great if the scope was all fields for the selected class (instead of for the entire project.)\n\nFor example:\n• Screenshot 1 shows a project-level - all fields field confidence rule applied (95% threshold)\n• screenshot 2 shows adding an `All Fields` field confidence rule from within the `Bank statement` class level\n• screenshot 3 shows the results of adding the second confidence rule: it double-applies a supposed `Project-wide` field confidence rule.\nInstead, I would expect to see the second configured rule:\n• nestled under `Bank statement` class\n• read something like: `Class-level field confidence >= 95%` with just the `Bank statement` class tag applied (I can see it being helpful to show all `class-wide` validations on the top for convenience, but maybe only as a supplement to seeing them presented under their respective classes.)",
