An input file will be split into records and each record will have a class label. It will then run extraction using that class's fields. For example, if an input file has a W2 followed by 2 paystubs, the W2 doc will be processed with the W2 fields, and paystubs will be processed by paystub fields. In the App results page, you'll see 3 sets of fields (1 W2, and 2 paystub), similar to if you had 3 files (1 W2, 2 paystubs)",
