I’ve reached out to a few pen-testing companies to gather quotes and time requirements for the overall testing plan.\n\nIn the interim, I have divided the tickets into 3 categories:\n1. SQL Injection: This is currently assigned to Warren because he was interested in looking at this.  I’ll follow up with him about this. (https://app.asana.com/0/845730230505446/845730230505476)\n2. XSS: Assigned to David to check with him on the capacity for handling these: https://app.asana.com/0/845730230505446/845849915554242\n3. Authorization Issues: I’ll do a quick evaluation of these to scope out the work.",
