Not sure how these files are stored, but if they are stored in S3, is it possible that only the most recent version was being deleted, and S3 was caching previous versions?",

So looks like it might be a difference in the py vs go s3 library? not sure if there are configs for controlling the caching policy via the api, i would’ve thought that would be related to how we setup s3.",
