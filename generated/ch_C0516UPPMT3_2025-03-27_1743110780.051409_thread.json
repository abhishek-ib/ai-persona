      "message": "Hey team, NAB are interested in implementing spot checks (particularly as volume were to ramp up) and wondered if this can be done in AI Hub?\n\nI feel like there will be some hacky way of doing this e.g. custom validation with random seed to fail every 100th doc or something, but do we have a native feature or ticket for this?",

      "message": "Do they plan on also having regular human review workflows, or just this spot check process? If it's just this spot check process, the random seed approach you described seems like it could work, but this would start to get messy if its mixed in with other validations. We don't have a way to route certain validation errors to one review queue or another - it's one queue per deployment.\n\nThe closest ticket I was able to find is this (https://instabase.atlassian.net/browse/EPD-1608) - though it's very old & has an inaccurate status. If it looks related we could reopen it & clean it up, but feel free to open a new one if needed.",
