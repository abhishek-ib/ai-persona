We’ve started with the most basic ones right now, but we hope to expand it to all the applications.  Let <#CV2A23127|> know if you’d love to contribute to this document :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nOnce @Mohit’s amazing working will be in, this document will become an artifact, but until then, whatever we can do to make our Customer’s life simpler, we should.",
