      "message": "Let me break this down:\n\n1. Purpose of `isDeployedSolutionOwnerKeyword`:\nThis function serves a special purpose in handling platform-owned/system solutions versus user-owned solutions. Looking at the constant definition:\n\n```// IBDeployedOwner is the owner column value for the platform deployed solutions app\n// The owner column usually stores a user ID. Putting this string into a column\n// that is usually joined on ACCOUNTS is necessary because the owner column is\n// part of the unique constraint for deployed solutions.\n// This allows us to store platform solutions and user-owned solutions in the same\n// data model while avoiding naming clashes\nIBDeployedOwner = \"IB_DEPLOYED\"```\nThe function helps distinguish between:\n- Platform-owned solutions (owner = “IB_DEPLOYED”)\n- User-owned solutions (owner = actual user account ID)\n\nThis distinction is important because platform solutions are system-level entities that aren’t owned by any specific user.\n\n2. OwnerID vs OwnerPublicID:\nThere are indeed two different ID types used:\n\n- `ownerID` (accounts.id): Internal database identifier, typically a UUID or similar unique identifier used for database relationships and joins\n- `ownerPublicID` (accounts.public_id): External/user-facing identifier, typically a username or similar human-readable identifier\n\nThe code includes two transformation functions to handle conversions between these:\n\n```// Converts public ID (username) to internal ID\nfunc (h *RepoServiceHandler) transformDeployedSolutionOwnerPublicID(ctx context.Context, ownerPublicID string)\n\n// Converts internal ID to public ID (username)\nfunc (h *RepoServiceHandler) transformDeployedSolutionOwnerID(ctx context.Context, ownerID string)```\nThese functions are used throughout the codebase to:\n1. Store the internal ID in the database (for efficiency and relationship integrity)\n2. Display the public ID in APIs and user interfaces (for readability and usability)\n3. Handle the special “IB_DEPLOYED” case by passing it through unchanged\n\nThis pattern is common in systems where you want to decouple internal database identifiers from user-facing identifiers while maintaining a special case for system-owned entities.",

      "message": "Thanks for clarifying @Anil ! I had a few follow-up questions (more high level):\n1. What are \"platform-owned/system solutions\" in this case? Are these inherently present in every deployment of AI Hub?\n2. In the implementations of `transform...`  functions, we check if either ownerPublicId OR ownerId is equal to IB_DEPLOYED. I'm a bit confused as to why we do this for both owner id and public id, perhaps the answer to question 1 might answer it though",
