In our APIs, we need to align our response codes to the Flow State.\n\nFor example, even if the job status is FAILED, we still get a 200 response.\n\nI have explained that the status code is only to indicate a successful request and the status of the flow was successfully retrieved. The flow state does not decide this.\n\nHowever, is it something that should be looked into?\n\ncc: @Aimé @Seb",
