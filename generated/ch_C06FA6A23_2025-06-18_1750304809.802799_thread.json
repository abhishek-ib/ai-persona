      "message": "Hi Team,\nWe've set up a pipeline to automatically clean up VMAlert and VictoriaMetrics image tags older than 20 days. This was done to resolve an issue where new tags couldn't be created due to a limit on the number of unique tags for an image with the same SHA (see <#C08UJ90SPLN|> for details).\n\n*Please note*: this might unintentionally remove images still in use in sandbox environments. If you encounter an `Image Pull` error for these services, simply re-deploy the sandbox by rebuilding VMAlert and VictoriaMetrics â€” that should fix the issue.",
