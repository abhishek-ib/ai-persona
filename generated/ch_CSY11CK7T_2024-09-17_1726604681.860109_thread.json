Creating Converse took a while so the side nav is stuck in the open state (ref (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/13937/overview/bf53bf4d-9312-4d7d-90a1-ca19718a6978/replay?roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1&ts=1726599970707.2&att=1), ref (https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/cfhedy/runs/13940/overview/226f1fda-5aec-4f8d-9c60-9dd60cf1a93f/replay?roarHideRunsWithDiffGroupsAndTags=1&ts=1726601509060.7&att=1))\n• `Shows Projects and Chats sections that track most recently accessed build projects and conversations` failed because we can't open the sidenav in Converse in the community user account and I can reproduce by logging into that user (see recording) :cry: . The page is laggy and frozen. The console shows that a mouseout, focusein, click events took a long time\nCan you look into this when you get a chance? I'll skip the tests in CI for now.",
