      "message": "When you want to go back to AI Hub from a public app, it proves painful since we currently link to the My Hub page. So the process ends up being - click on my hub --> then click on discover. For public apps, this doesn't make sense since the user will be coming from the discover page anyways. And for the majority of users, they may not even have private apps on the My Hub page.\n\n@alagu, should we edit this to link back to the AI Hub page from an app (or at least for a public app) instead of My Hub?",
