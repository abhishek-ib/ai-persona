      "message": "@Carolyn what do you mean by a “heavy java development shop” exactly?\nRight now, UDF development is mainly used for upstream / downstream integration, and data cleaning after model extraction. Instabase interfaces with client downstream / upstream usually through REST APIs. So no matter what language their downstream / upstream is programmed, as long as it provides REST API endpoints, IB can talk to those systems.\n\nInstabase doesn’t support letting users write Java custom code on top of the platform. Enabling this is big effort and personally I think is not a good time investment for us. If they have 0 developers who know how to write Python, they probably need to think about paying for some professional services work.",
