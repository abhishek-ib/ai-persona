I think this is because the FE uses some cached gt set data, aka if you update app > go to gt set management > refresh, the status should be as expected. I imagine there are tradeoffs to always re-fetching status but @Serena is this a known bug\n2. name render bug after a gt set re-run (not due to accuracy run test)",
